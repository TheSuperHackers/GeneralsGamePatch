 Generals Zero Hour - Unit Quotes

 This file was created as a documentation of sound file transcription of
 every unit voices of C&C Generals and its Zero Hour expansion, including
 the file names for easy searching.

 This file only list the files under "Data/Audio/Sounds/English/" folder.
 For EVA voices and Generals taunts, please refer the "generals.csf" or
 "generals.str" file. Find the CSF Editor or the converted STR file
 yourself.


 Note that not every voices were actually used ingame. Some were cut due
 to various factors, thus they could be reused again.


 How To Read File Name
 ---------------------
 Most voice files in Generals have their names composed by 7 letters.

 The first letter is corresponding to unit type. Common types are:
  i = infantry
  v = vehicle
  b = building
  a = ambient
  m = mission related

 The next three letters are corresponding to the shortened unit name.

 After that, the next two letters are what the voice intended action is.
 Common types are:
  se = select (voice when a unit is selected, and one is the built voice)
  mo = move (when ordered to move)
  at = attack (ordered to attack)
  a2 = secondary attack (mostly attacking air, or special ability)
  di = death voice
  fe = feared (when reallydamaged)
  m* = special ability mode (* can be any letter depending on the mode)

 And the last letter is the variation of the voice. Since you don't want
 only one voice per action. It's a~z since normally there's no more
 than 26 voice variations.

 Example: vhummoa
          v  -------> vehicle
           hum  ----> Humvee
              mo  --> move voice
                a  -> first variation

 Chinese EVA:

 mc1xoc01 -  "Greetings, Comrade General. I am Lin Zhong, your Senior
              Intelligence Officer. Today, as we claimed a rightful
              place among the world's leading nations, your troops will
              provide security for the glorious display of our military
              strength. The People's Army will not tired in our pursuit
              of the terrorist enemy."
 mc1xoc02 -  "The GLA hope to deter us with their cowardly attack. We
              will now strike back and destroy the GLA. Make them pay,
              General!"
 mc1xoc03 -  "A few tanks survived, General! Our Battlemaster Tanks are
              vastly superior to anything the GLA can send against us.
              Like many of our units, they are more effective in large
              groups. (I think he will be pleased...)"
 mc1xoc04 -  "General, keep your forces back! A Fire Strike is on the
              way!"
 mc1xoc05 -  "One final task remains, General. Destroy the weapons
              stockpile to deny the GLA control of our nuclear arsenal!"
 mc1xoc06 -  "General, China has never submit such great devastation!
              Strike swiftly and mercilessly! The GLA shall witness the
              true might of China's Army!"
 mc1xoc07 -  "You have discovered more survivors of the GLA attack,
              General!"
 mc1xoc08 -  "You have discovered another survivor of the GLA attack,
              General!"
 mc1xoc09 -  "We have reached the weapons storage facility, General.
              Destroy it to prevent any further GLA attacks on our
              people!"
 mc1xoc10 -  "You have discovered an alternate route into the GLA Base,
              General! Resistance should be much lighter from this
              direction."
 mc1xoc11 -  "General, these Troop Crawlers are returning from patrol.
              The added manpower will be welcomed reinforcements for our
              main force."
 mc1xoc12 -  "The GLA appear determined to hold the weapons facility,
              General. It would seem that they are in need of a
              demonstration of China's military might."
 mc1xoc13 -  "Tiger Wing, we have pulled back from the area! You are now
              clear to commence your attack!"
 mc1xoc14 -  "After you've been promoted, make sure to left-click the
              blinking General Star on your Command Bar to apply your
              skill points."

 Ferry Boat Owner:

 mc2aut01 -  "Those terrorists are ruining my business! If you put your
              forces aboard, I will take you out to the Convention
              Center... then sneak in and catch them by surprise... Just

 mc2re202 -  "We're building our base on the field??"
 mc2re203 -  "General, toxin base inside!"

 Chinese EVA:

 mc2xoc01 -  "General, an active GLA Cell has been amassed in Hong Kong.
              We suspected the Terrorists have targeted buildings in the
              commercial center. The Cell must be crushed and its
              members eradicated. Strike hard, General, and without
              mercy!"
 mc2xoc02 -  "General, that's all that's left of the assault force. We
              need to build a Command Center and a radar dish!"
 mc2xoc03 -  "General, we cannot track the enemy without the radar. We
              need to get that radar online!"
 mc2xoc04 -  "We need to finish building our base. The Barracks, Nuclear
              Reactor, and Supply Center, are all are essential to your
              mission. Construct them immediately. I will contact you
              again once your base is completed."
 mc2xoc05 -  "Excellent! Your base is completed, except for a War
              Factory... We need one now. There should be a surplus base
              with a War Factory here..."
 mc2xoc06 -  "Get there as soon as possible, General!"
 mc2xoc07 -  "The GLA are targeting key buildings around the city. Our
              main objective is to destroy all the GLA forces, but.. if
              we can also keep them from destroying those buildings, our
              leaders will be most grateful."
 mc2xoc08 -  "If you can keep your radar operating, I can track the
              Terrorists for you and give you their possible targets."
 mc2xoc09 -  "General, a Terrorist is leaving the Convention Center.
              I'll mark the Terrorists in red on your radar. I'll mark
              his possible targets in yellow. Stop him before he reaches
              one of those targets!"
 mc2xoc10 -  "Another Terrorist has left the Convention Center. I'll
              mark his location in red. His possible targets are marked
              in yellow. Stop him, General!"
 mc2xoc11 -  "General, this building is a Terrorist target. We must
              protect it!"
 mc2xoc12 -  "General, the Terrorists have taken over the Convention
              Center. You are going to have to destroy it and the
              attached parking structures to stop the Terrorists
              threat."
 mc2xoc13 -  "Excellent! You've reached the surplus base! It's not much
              to look at, but it were allowed you to build tanks and
              more War Factory."
 mc2xoc14 -  "The Terrorists threat is finished. Good work, General!"
 mc2xoc15 -  "General, I detected GLA armored units on the move. They
              didn't come from the Convention Center, so the GLA must
              have another base somewhere in Hong Kong. Find that base
              and destroy it!"
 mc2xoc16 -  "General, the GLA have sent in their Toxin Tractors. They
              fire a toxic green goos. Keep your infantry away from them
              and use your tanks to deal with this new threat!"
 mc2xoc17 -  "Good work, General! You've destroyed that Toxin Base. Now
              they shouldn't be able to build any more Toxin Tractors."
 mc2xoc18 -  "Wait, General! There are large forces up ahead. I'll call
              for an EMP Strike to clear the area. Stand by!"
 mc2xoc19 -  "That should give you a clear path to their base. Let's
              finish this, General!"
 mc2xoc20 -  "Sir, a building has fallen to Terrorists attack!"
 mc2xoc21 -  "General, another building has been destroyed by
              Terrorists!"
 mc2xoc22 -  "The Terrorists have destroyed another building, General!!"
 mc2xoc23 -  "General, the Terrorists have destroyed all of their
              targets. Our leaders will not be pleased..."
 mc2xoc24 -  "...and you managed to protect some of the Terrorists
              targets! Our leaders are pleased. They are sending
              additional resources to show their gratitude."
 mc2xoc25 -  "...and you managed to protect all the Terrorists targets.
              Our leaders are greatly pleased. They are sending
              additional resources and support to show their gratitude."
 mc2xoc26 -  "...but the Terrorists destroyed all of their targets. We

 Black Lotus:

 mc3bla01 -  "It's too late, the base is lost! All forces retreat to the
              Dam! I have a plan..."
 mc3bla02 -  "Destroy the dam! Flooding the valley is the only way we
              can stop the GLA now. Hurry, before the forces escape!"
 mc3bla03 -  "It was a terrible price. That should be the end of them."
 mc3bla04 -  "We must hurry! There should be emergency supplies here."
 mc3bla05 -  "We need to build more forces before the GLA cross the

 mc3xoc02 -  "Most of the GLA armor was destroyed by the flood, but they
              are still crawling all over the town across the river.
              They must have another base near there."
 mc3xoc03 -  "Sir, the GLA will be able to cross the river soon. Let's

 mc3xoc04 -  "General, the GLA Supply Pile is sitting in the middle of
              the town. If we can cut them off from their supplies,

              operative Black Lotus. Once the strike team locate the

              they will be trapped on their island"

              American base, and the resulting explosion will be
              devastating. Perhaps a well-placed Bomb Truck and..."

              bunkers!"

              Americans will win this battle!"

              authorized our forces to take him out. He is no doubt
              brought some heavy equipment with him, so be prepared!"
 mu7xou05 -  "General, you've got to destroy the Nuclear Missile Silo!
              I don't know if our base can survive another hit."
 mu7xou06 -  "General, we should take advantage of the additional
              supplies to the south!"
 mu7xou07 -  "General, now the Chinese targets have been eliminated, we can concentrate on the GLA!"
 mu7xou08 -  "General, the GLA have been defeated. We should try to
              destroy the Chinese before they can build up any more
              forces!"

              Hehehehe!"
 tairf002 -  "Hey, General! Did you see that Stealth Fighter? Khehehe!"
 tairf003 -  "BIRDS AWAY! Let's go hunt some Dozers!"
 tairf004 -  "I'm done playing with you, General... EVERYONE, ATTACK!"
 tairf005 -  "Will ya look at that... US Military spending at its best!"
 tairf006 -  (singing badly) "Hum-hmm-hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm!! The bombs
             bursting in air~! Hehehehe..."
 tairf007 -  "Here comes the rain of terror, General!"
 tairf008 -  "How are you enjoying the Shock & Awe, General?"
 tairf009 -  "Death from above!"
 tairf010 -  "Doesn't seem fair, does it, General?"
 tairf011 -  "It's time to pull the goalies! Everyone attack!"
 tairf012 -  "Bombs away!"
 tairf013 -  "It's awfully quiet out there... You didn't leave, did you,
              General?"
 tairf014 -  "Don't worry, General, this is just the quiet before the
              storm!"
 tairf015 -  "I'd take this break to rebuild your defenses, General!"
 tairf016 -  "Shush..! Did you hear that? ...I wouldn't worry... it's
              probably nothing. (giggling)"
 tairf017 -  "Sorry, General! We're just taking a lunch break. Be with
              you in a minute."
 tairf018 -  "You've forced me to use tanks! I HATE using tanks..."
 tairf019 -  "Havin' trouble crossin' the river, General? You wanna
              lift? Hahahaha!"
 tairf020 -  "Cowards! Stop hiding and fight!"
 tairf021 -  "Stealth won't save you, General! We'll find you!"
 tairf022 -  "Ouch, that must have been expensive!"
 tairf023 -  "Huh, where are you going to train your troops now?"
 tairf024 -  "Having trouble keeping up those defenses, General?"
 tairf025 -  "You've lost a lot of buildings, General! Were ya planning
              on using... harsh language now?"
 tairf026 -  "Dozers, start repairing our buildings!"
 tairf027 -  "I'll get you for this, General!"
 tairf028 -  "You'll regret destroying that Airfield, General!"
 tairf029 -  "Dozers, rebuild our defenses!"
 tairf030 -  "This is General Granger to Aircraft Carrier Olympia! Send
              reinforcements! Repeat, send reinforcements!"
 tairf031 -  "They're attacking the Command Center! All forces,
              regroup!"
 tairf032 -  "I don't appreciate you shooting down my planes, General.."
 tairf033 -  "They're taking over our Oil Derricks! Rangers, get out
              there and take them back!"
 tairf034 -  "Get out of our base!"
 tairf035 -  "Get out of my airspace, General!"
 tairf036 -  "The enemy is in our perimeter! All planes return to base!"
 tairf037 -  "Ground forces, defend the Airfields!"
 tairf038 -  "You're not stealing my supplies, are you, General?"
 tairf039 -  "They're coming in the backdoor!"
 tairf040 -  "Hiding in the village, eh? That's a coward's tactic,
              General!"
 tairf041 -  "Stop hiding, General! Don't make me come and getcha!"
 tairf042 -  "They're at the East Gate!"
 tairf043 -  "Defend the East side!"
 tairf044 -  "Enemy forces approaching the West Gate!"
 tairf045 -  "All forces to the West Gate!"
 tairf046 -  "Havin' trouble keepin' your power up, General?"
 tairf047 -  "Oops, your power's down... Here come the bombs!"
 tairf048 -  "Outta... resources, General? You wanna borrow some?
              Hahahaha!"
 tairf049 -  "Hey, General, heheh... Ehh... how 'bout we call this one
              a draw?"
 tairf050 -  "You may have won the battle, General... but the war is far
              from over!"
 tairf051 -  "So, you built a SCUD Storm. Think you can defend it?"
 tairf052 -  "Hmm, that's a lot of anti-air, General! Think it will be
              enough to calm the fear?"
 tairf053 -  "Your tanks are no match for my planes, General!"
 tairf054 -  "Anthrax! Everybody find cover!"
 tairf055 -  "Garrison all the buildings you want, General! It won't
              help."
 tairf056 -  "How much more of this can you take, General?"
 tairf057 -  "Err... Ready to surrender yet?"
 tairf058 -  "Haven't you lost enough troops, General?"
 tairf059 -  "This battle is over, General! Surrender, or prepare to
              die!"
 tairf060 -  "Not gonna surrender, huh? Too bad... Heheheheheh!"
 tairf061 -  "BOMBS AWAY, PUNK!"
 tairf062 -  "Come on, General! I'll show you the meaning of Death From
              Above!"
 tairf063 -  "Sonic boom, baby! Let's do this thing!"
 tairf064 -  "Sigh, guess it's time for me to go find a good airline
              job..."
 tairf065 -  "I win! You lose... What more is there to say?"
 tairf066 -  "BE ADVISED! This area is under the control of Air Force
              General Malcolm Granger! Withdraw now.. or prepare to be
              bombed back to the Stone Age!"
 tairf067 -  "General, you're no match for me! I own the skies!"
 tairf068 -  "Watch the skies, General! We're gonna put on an air show!"
 tairf069 -  "Wanna see it again? Heheheheh!"
 tairf070 -  "Ready or not, here I come!"
 tairf071 -  "You don't mind if we drop in~ do ya General?"
 tairf072 -  "That's TWO of my Airfields you've hit, General! I'm
              starting to get annoyed!"
 tairf073 -  "Curse you, General! If you hit another Airfield, I'll come
              for you personally!"
 tairf074 -  "That's the last Airfield you destroy today! Forces, target
              their Command Center!"
 tairf075 -  "I can't believe you beat me, General! I salute your
              superior tactics!"
 tairf076 -  "Sigh... Looks like you defeated me this time, General...
              But we'll meet again someday! And I won't be so merciful
              because-"
 tairf077 -  "I thought he'd never shut up..."
 tairf078 -  "You don't think Imma let you keep that SCUD Storm, do ya?"
 tairf079 -  "Another SCUD Storm?? Guess it's time to take the up a
              notch!"
 tairf080 -  "Pilots, watch out for those Stinger Sites!"
 tairf081 -  "So many Rangers, so few buildings to be captured.
              Khuhuhuhu..."
 tairf082 -  "General! Do ya know how a Fuel Air Bomb works? Eh... how
              'bout a demonstration? Hahahaha!"
 tairf083 -  "Welcome to the party, Colonel Burton! You're in for it
              now, General."

 tairf087 -  "You know that SCUD Launcher is never gonna make it to my
              base, right?"
 tairf088 -  "Wait... that's a Bomb Truck! Everyone look out!!"
 tairf089 -  "You've forced me to use tanks!! I hate using tanks..."      >> slight variation to tairf018

 tchib001 -  "So, I see you have decided to stay and stand against me.
              You will regret that decision, General! Prepare to meet
              your end~! Hehe..."
 tchib002 -  "The Tiger stands poised to strike, General..."
 tchib003 -  "For China! Charge!"
 tchib004 -  "My forces are ready to engage your defenses, General!"
 tchib005 -  "Feel the stomping feet of my Iron Dragon!"
 tchib006 -  "Your defenses are WORTHLESS against MY forces!"
 tchib007 -  "Now we meet in the field of honor, General..."
 tchib008 -  "This we do for the good of China!"
 tchib009 -  "It is time to test your steel, General!"
 tchib010 -  "You have attacked me for the last time, General. This wave
              will break your defenses and crush your pitiful army to
              dust!"
 tchib011 -  "The might of China falls upon you!"
 tchib012 -  "Your inferior forces will provide NO challenge for my
              warriors!"
 tchib013 -  "You began this fight, General! Now I will finish it!
              Hehehe..."
 tchib014 -  "Attack the fool! Take no prisoners!"
 tchib015 -  "Two warriors meet on the battlefield. Who is to say who
              will win? I DO, that's who! ME! You will fall, General!"
 tchib016 -  "A fight that cannot be won is not worth fighting. So why
              are you here, General?"
 tchib017 -  "Rage will only get you so far, General! Now rage and a
              column of tanks... that will get you somewhere."
 tchib018 -  "You find yourself at the end of your rope, General! And
              only now have you discovered that the end of that rope is
              on fire."
 tchib019 -  "The dance of battle is strange and brief... and this
              battle with you has been... strangely brief!
              Khuhuhuhuhuhu..."
 tchib020 -  "Meh, I see you haven't thought your strategy through.
              Pity..."
 tchib021 -  "THAT is a losing strategy, General!"
 tchib022 -  "You are not acting for the good of you people, General!"
 tchib023 -  "I will give you a moments pause... to consider your next
              move."
 tchib024 -  "A wise man knows when to retreat. Obviously, you are not
              such a man."
 tchib025 -  "In the end, all fall before me!"
 tchib026 -  "You cannot stand against my might!"
 tchib027 -  "China cannot be defeated by one man!"
 tchib028 -  "We shall mediate and consider our next move!"
 tchib029 -  "Do not commit to a tactic you cannot support!"
 tchib030 -  "Suicide is not a tactic, General!"                    >> uses suicide bikes anyway
 tchib031 -  "We sweep away your buildings like bamboo before a
              hurricane!"
 tchib032 -  "Your men ran from the Barracks as we knocked it to the
              ground!"
 tchib033 -  "A factory cannot produce war, General! And now your War
              Factory produces nothing!"
 tchib034 -  "Your Airfield has been grounded, General!"
 tchib035 -  "Your base defenses fall before us like blades of grass!"
 tchib036 -  "We've destroyed your Command Center, so... where are you
              hiding now, General?"
 tchib037 -  "So many of your buildings have fallen that I would have
              expected you to surrender by now!"
 tchib038 -  "Don't think you can destroy my Barracks without feeling my
              wrath, General!"
 tchib039 -  "I'll have to rebuild that War Factory now... You would be
              wise to exploit my momentary weakness. It won't last."
 tchib040 -  "Dozers! Rebuild the Airfield before our MiGs return!"
 tchib041 -  "Our defenses are cracking! Repel the invaders!"
 tchib042 -  "That is quite enough destruction, General! Now it is my 
              turn!"
 tchib043 -  "You can claim my Command Center... but this battle isn't
              over, General!"
 tchib044 -  "We will avenge all those MiGs you've destroyed, General!"
 tchib045 -  "The price of this war is too high, General! Now it is time
              for you to pay!"
 tchib046 -  "China's infantry is plentiful, but too many have been
              sacrificed! Now I will return your cruelty... tenfold!"
 tchib047 -  "Capture all the Oil you wish! You will not have time to
              reap the rewards!"
 tchib048 -  "That Artillery Platform can be easily avoided, General!"
 tchib049 -  "Seeking to increase your efficiency with that Oil
              Refinery, General? A solid strategy would have served you
              better!"
 tchib050 -  "Something stirs at the edge of my base..."
 tchib051 -  "I see you approaching my base, General!"
 tchib052 -  "You will not live to regret entering my base, General!"
 tchib053 -  "You forces may enter my base, but they will never leave
              again."
 tchib054 -  "Those resources are under my protection, General!"
 tchib055 -  "Why do you insist on attacking from the flanks??"
 tchib056 -  "Interesting attack, General, but it will not succeed
              against me!"
 tchib057 -  "A brave attack, General! But bravery alone will not defeat
              me!"
 tchib058 -  "THAT, is a fool's tactic, General!"
 tchib059 -  "Leave this place before you anger me!"
 tchib060 -  "I can see what you are doing, General! I will not allow
              it!"
 tchib061 -  "Run away from here, General, before I UNLEASH the horde on
              you!"
 tchib062 -  "We are approaching your base, General! What is your
              defense?"
 tchib063 -  "Are you prepared for our attack, General? We shall see..."
 tchib064 -  "Your defenses are ugh... inadequate, General!"
 tchib065 -  "Now we will begin leveling your base, General!"
 tchib066 -  "Your resources will soon be mine!"
 tchib067 -  "I claim this Oil Derrick for China!"
 tchib068 -  "Your flanks are exposed, General... Fatal mistake!"
 tchib069 -  "You have allowed my forces to subvert your defenses! Now,
              we will finish you!"
 tchib070 -  "You have allowed your power to drop, General! Pray that
              isn't a fatal mistake!"
 tchib071 -  "Without power, you won't be able to defend your base,
              General!"
 tchib072 -  "You have exhausted your resources, General! It is time to
              admit defeat!"
 tchib073 -  "You have taxed my resources, General! Now I will come and
              take yours!"
 tchib074 -  "The SCUD Storm is a cowardly weapon, General! I thought
              more of you..."                                           >> et tu, Leang?
 tchib075 -  "You are forcing me to answer with a Nuclear Silo of my
              own, General!"
 tchib076 -  "That Particle Cannon is a formidable weapon, but it cannot
              stop China!"
 tchib077 -  "So many defenses... I see you have proper respect for your
              enemy."
 tchib078 -  "You cannot build more tanks than China, General!"
 tchib079 -  "We will match you planes in the air, General! Your
              superiority will be only in your mind!"
 tchib080 -  "Your men are outnumbered, General! Do not try to make a
              greater horde than China!"
 tchib081 -  "Your base grows LARGE, General... ripe for a nuclear
              strike!"
 tchib082 -  "Red Guard, scatter! SCUD missiles inbound!"           >> but you use Rangers
 tchib083 -  "We are immune to your nuclear missiles, General!"
 tchib084 -  "NO!! Your particle beam will only injure us! We will not
              forget this, General!"
 tchib085 -  "Hide in those buildings, General! Perhaps a Dragon Tank
              will come to visit you."
 tchib086 -  "Colonel Burton's exploits are legendary, but he is only
              one man, General!"
 tchib087 -  "I see you have corrupted one of our Black Lotus agents.
              Her training will not turn the battle to your favor,
              General!"
 tchib088 -  "Oooh... The sniper Kell enters our battle! Do not count on
              his stealth to save you, General!"
 tchib089 -  "You are foolish to build an Airfield, General! Only TANKS
              can save you from me!"
 tchib090 -  "You are wise to build a War Factory, General!"
 tchib091 -  "That Barracks is only the beginning of what you will need
              to defeat me, General!"
 tchib092 -  "If you are going to sell your buildings, why do you bother
              constructing them?"
 tchib093 -  "You will not defeat me this easily, General!"
 tchib094 -  "Your advantage will not hold!"
 tchib095 -  "I will not be beaten by the likes of you, General!"
 tchib096 -  "This is not the end, General! I will recover from this!"
 tchib097 -  "I must acknowledge this defeat... You have shown superior
              tactics, General."
 tchib098 -  "My superior tactics are leading to your defeat, General!"
 tchib099 -  "You are losing this battle, General! Better to accept
              defeat honorably than to fight on..."
 tchib100 -  "The end is drawing near for you, General!"
 tchib101 -  "Why do you resist the inevitable, General?"
 tchib102 -  "The shadow of The Dragon signals the beginning of your
              defeat, General... It is time to accept your defeat!"
 tchib103 -  "It is time to accept your defeat, General."
 tchib104 -  "It is time for The Dragon to rise again!"
 tchib105 -  "There is no shame in accepting your weakness."
 tchib106 -  "You are not ready to face me! Return when your training is
              complete!"
 tchib107 -  "Why do you run towards your own demise?"
 tchib108 -  "This has been an interesting contest. Perhaps you will
              challenge me again?"
 tchib109 -  "Improve your skills and challenge me again!"
 tchib110 -  "Welcome, General! I hope you are prepared to face me."
 tchib111 -  "Your victories speak well of your ability, but my Generals
              did not have my cunning or experience!"
 tchib112 -  "Soon you will see what it is to face The Dragon!"

 tdemo001 -  "I have some surprises for you, General! Why don't you come
              out and play?"
 tdemo002 -  "Now that the field is covered with explosives, I suppose
              we'll attack. Hehehahahahaha!"
 tdemo003 -  "General, I have a delivery for you! Sign for it, won't
              you? Heheheheheheh!"
 tdemo004 -  "Careful, who knows when Jarmen Kell will sneak into your
              base!"
 tdemo005 -  "Did your building just blow up? Hmm... I wonder how that
              happened..."
 tdemo006 -  "All of my forces are packed with explosives, General! I
              wouldn't shoot at them if I were you."
 tdemo007 -  "Hehe, My Terrorists have learned to disguise themselves
              as- *gasp*! Have I said too much? Hehehehehe..."
 tdemo008 -  "You might notice that my explosives pack a BIT more punch.
              I hope you appreciate our attention to quality.
              Hehehehehehe..."
 tdemo009 -  "Look how quickly the SCUD Launcher destroys a building
              now! Just wait, it's amazing!"
 tdemo010 -  "First, all is silence... then... BOOM!! Ahh... don't you
              just love it, General?"
 tdemo011 -  "I rarely attack. You should feel honored! Hehahahahahaha!"
 tdemo012 -  "Here comes another attack, General!"
 tdemo013 -  "My troops are coming to assault your base! Make them feel
              welcome! Hahahahahaha!"
 tdemo014 -  "Oh please ignore my Workers, General... They're just
              burying some... umm... garbage for me. Khuhuhuhuhuhu..."
 tdemo015 -  "Oh General, you must see this! IT'S THE BOMB! Ngahahaha!"
 tdemo016 -  "We're going out for more explosives, General! Be right
              back! Hehe hehehehehehe..."
 tdemo017 -  "It's quiet out there, General... You know what quiet means
              right? BOOOM...!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA..."
 tdemo018 -  "I.. am Master of Explosives, General. You have NO defense
              against me!"
 tdemo019 -  "Your base, has been targeted for demolition!"
 tdemo020 -  "Do you fear my next attack, General? You should~"
 tdemo021 -  "As we speak, my agents are sneaking into your base and
              planting explosives."
 tdemo022 -  "Your building could be wired to explode right now~! You'll
              never know... until it's too late!"
 tdemo023 -  "There are few units that can detect my demolitions. Do you
              know which ones they are? Hehehehehe..."
 tdemo024 -  "Demo Traps are difficult to construct, General! To truly
              appreciate their beauty you have to see one up close.
              Khuhuhu..."
 tdemo025 -  "How are you enjoying my tricks and traps so far, eh?
              Hehehehehe..."
 tdemo026 -  "Aww... your Tech Building went booooom..."
 tdemo027 -  "We've destroyed your Barracks! I hope no one was in there.
              Hehe hehehe hehehe..."
 tdemo028 -  "Your War Factory has fallen, General! Oh build another one
              so we can knock it down again, eh! Hahahahahahaha!"
 tdemo029 -  "Airfields are so fragile... It's hardly even fun to
              destroy them, hmm!?"
 tdemo030 -  "Your base defenses cannot take my explosives, General!"
 tdemo031 -  "Ah... there's nothing quite like destroying a Command
              Center, no?"
 tdemo032 -  "We have destroyed so many of your buildings, General! I
              appreciate you building more for our amusement!"
 tdemo033 -  "You've destroyed our Oil Derrick! Now you're getting into
              the spirit of things!"
 tdemo034 -  "My Barracks!! Many of my demolitions were in there,
              General! I'll make you pay for this!"
 tdemo035 -  "Not my War Factory! General, this annoying habit you've
              developed cannot continue!!"
 tdemo036 -  "Not to worry, my base defenses are only an early-warning
              signal. Now you must walk through my true defenses,
              hehahehaha..."
 tdemo037 -  "Too many... You've destroy TOO MANY of my structures,
              General! Now the fighting gets dirty!"
 tdemo038 -  "We will rebuild that Command Center, General. and you will
              pay for this transgression!"
 tdemo039 -  "General, how do you expect me to defeat you if you keep
              destroying my vehicles??"
 tdemo040 -  "You're cutting my men down before they can place their
              demolitions!! That doesn't seem right, does it, General??"
 tdemo041 -  "Ah yes! Capture that Oil Derrick, General! Then we'll have
              more to destroy, hahahahaha..."
 tdemo042 -  "General, why do you want that Artillery Platform?"
 tdemo043 -  "Good, General! Capture the Oil Refinery! They blow up SO
              dramatically!"
 tdemo044 -  "Be careful, General... your men have just enter the danger
              zone around my base! Even I don't remember where all the
              traps are set out there..."
 tdemo045 -  "General, your men are coming dangerously close to my base!
              I would turn back if I were you."
 tdemo046 -  "Get out of my base, General! This whole area is wired with
              explosives, and I'm not afraid to use them"
 tdemo047 -  "You fool.. Do you know how many explosives are surrounding
              your men right now?!"
 tdemo048 -  "Attacking from the flank, General? There might be a few
              defenses there, but... what about the traps?"
 tdemo049 -  "Nuh-uh! The back of my base is particularly nasty,
              General! I wouldn't recommend an assault from there."
 tdemo050 -  "A frontal assault?! You are more of a fool than I thought,
              General!"
 tdemo051 -  "There is NOTHING in this valley for you except death!"
 tdemo052 -  "Careful, General, this looks like a good place for an
              ambush! ...oops, too late~! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
 tdemo053 -  "You think I didn't prepare for you coming here, General?
              Fool..."
 tdemo054 -  "Those are MY resources, General! Go find your own!"
 tdemo055 -  "General, you have entered my demolitions storage facility!
              One false move... and we ALL die!"
 tdemo056 -  "Ah, I see we hit one of your power lines! I hope your
              power isn't out for too long! HEHEHEHAHAHA...!!"
 tdemo057 -  "Tsk tsk tsk tsk... Your dependency on electricity will be
              you undoing, General!"
 tdemo058 -  "Your resources are exhausted, General! My forces are
              circling for the kill~!"
 tdemo059 -  "My resources are low, General. Mind if we come and take
              some of yours? Hehehahaha..."
 tdemo060 -  "A SCUD Storm? I see... Well, perhaps it is time to build
              one of my own!"
 tdemo061 -  "I wonder how many explosives it will take to destroy that
              Nuclear Silo. Hahahahaha..."
 tdemo062 -  "Now why do you want to build a Particle Cannon? We were
              just beginning to have fun, General!"
 tdemo063 -  "So many base defenses... How do you expect my bombers to
              enter your base now?"
 tdemo064 -  "Tanks... so many tanks! I'll enjoy watching your tanks hit
              my traps, General! Hahahahaha!"
 tdemo065 -  "Oh, stop building planes, General...! You'll miss the
              genius of my traps! Mwhahahahahaha...!"
 tdemo066 -  "With that many infantry you're sure to set off my Demo
              Traps! I'd tell them to spread out when crossing the field,
              General! ...or not."
 tdemo067 -  "So many buildings... Your base is a perfect target for my
              explosives, General. Thank you!"
 tdemo068 -  "Ah, foolish move, General. Your SCUD Storm won't stop me!"
 tdemo069 -  "Nuclear missile!? Heh, you will pay for this, General..."
 tdemo070 -  "No no no.. That particle beam will set off my explosives!"
 tdemo071 -  "Yes... Garrison that building, General, it probably
              doesn't have explosives attached to it! Hahahahaha..."
 tdemo072 -  "Hello, Colonel Burton! Umm try not to step on any traps.
              Khuhuhuhuhu..."
 tdemo073 -  "Black Lotus... just because you can detect my traps, do
              not think that I am now vulnerable."
 tdemo074 -  "Why would you send Jarmen Kell against me, General?"
 tdemo075 -  "Oh do not build any more Airfield, General, I don't like
              them."
 tdemo076 -  "The War Factory builds vehicles... vehicles that will set
              off my Demo Traps, hahahahaha!"
 tdemo077 -  "Do you think it is wise to build a Barracks, General?"
 tdemo078 -  "Oh please, General, don't sell off what I could destroy
              for you! Hehehahahahaha!"
 tdemo079 -  "General, you're not playing fair! Now go step on some
              traps! Hehehehehe..."
 tdemo080 -  "You are exceptionally lucky, General, but you cannot
              avoid my Demo Traps forever!"
 tdemo081 -  "No one has beaten my traps, General... and you won't be
              the first! You'll see..."
 tdemo082 -  "Do you think you're beating me, General? This could change
              in an instant! I don't fight fair~"
 tdemo083 -  "You may have defeated me, General... but Deathstrike will
              avenge me!"
 tdemo084 -  "Ha ha ha! Your troops are falling to my traps, General!
              Soon they'll all be gone!"
 tdemo085 -  "You're losing, General! My tactics elude you!"
 tdemo086 -  "You'll never defeat me, General... You should leave
              before you get hurt!"
 tdemo087 -  "I have SO many explosives left! More explosives than you
              have forces, I'm afraid. Hehehehehe..."
 tdemo088 -  "You lose, General! Too bad!"
 tdemo089 -  "I have just the thing! Let's go make war...!"
 tdemo090 -  "Demolitions expert: How can I help you? Hehehehehe!"
 tdemo091 -  "I wonder if I could wire that button to explode..."
 tdemo092 -  "Please, General, enter my battlefield! But... watch where
              you step!"
 tdemo093 -  "You were lucky this time, General... You could never beat
              me again!"
 tdemo094 -  "You were not prepared for this kind of war. Try again! If
              you dare..."
 tdemo095 -  "Here we see the battlefield... open... untouched by
              battle... a blank slate for our little-"
 tdemo096 -  "Now WHERE did those Demo Traps come from? Hehe, hehe,
              hehehehehe..."
 tdemo097 -  "Perhaps I have a few cards hidden up my sleeve, but... did
              you except any less from me, General?"
 tdemo098 -  (laughing) "Hehehehehehehe...!"
 tdemo099 -  (taunting) "Huh? Huh?? AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"
 tdemo100 -  "Oops!"
 tdemo101 -  "BOOOM!! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...!"

              Perhaps this will be worthwhile after all."

 tglab003 -  "Your men are like sheep before my warriors!"
 tglab004 -  "Look at all the wonderful toys you have brought to me! I

              break yours!"
 tglab005 -  "Your forces fall like wheat before my sword!"
 tglab006 -  "You have done well against my Generals, but I have all of
              their power combined! What will you do against that,
              General?"
 tglab007 -  "You... will never even see my forces, General! Until it is

 tglab010 -  "You have dared to challenge me?? Now you will reap the
              terrible reward!"
 tglab011 -  "How do you feel, General, as the horsemen ride to your
              doorstep?"
 tglab012 -  "You've had your chance to retreat, now we will annihilate
              you!"
 tglab013 -  "Bear witness to the power of my will, General!"
 tglab014 -  "My rage will tear your war machine to dust!"
 tglab015 -  "Toxin, explosives, stealth... Any one of these you have
              defeated, but all three?? All is lost, General! You should
              surrender~ for the good of your men!"
 tglab016 -  "Your world has made you soft, General! Mine... has made me
              strong!"
 tglab017 -  "You will learn to respect my power, General!"
 tglab018 -  "You will pause while I build my next attack! Then, the
              battle will resume."
 tglab019 -  "Have you grown tired dying against my defenses, General?"
 tglab020 -  "The battlefield is quiet, General! Are you waiting for me
              to finish this?"
 tglab021 -  "We await your next pathetic attack with great
              anticipation, hehe..."
 tglab022 -  "Has this been the extent of your power, General? Truly
              pathetic!"
 tglab023 -  "Your attacks have been like pathetic screams amidst the
              howl of a raging storm!"
 tglab024 -  "This battle is beginning to bore me, General!"
 tglab025 -  "Hmm, how much longer should I let you live, General?"
 tglab026 -  "General, my subject require my attention! How much longer
              do you intend to dance around like a clown?"
 tglab027 -  "General, your tactics remind me of a child learning to
              play chess!"
 tglab028 -  "Are you done, General? Have you... exhausted your pathetic
              resources?"
 tglab029 -  "General, I was bored minutes ago... Now I'm beginning to
              fall asleep!"
 tglab030 -  "How does it feel to challenge a true military genius?"
 tglab031 -  "Anything you gain, I will destroy!"
 tglab032 -  "Now your Barracks falls! Soon, all shall fall!"
 tglab033 -  "Your War Factory is lost! Rebuild it, and I'll destroy it
              again!"
 tglab034 -  "I have relieved you of your Airfield, General!"
 tglab035 -  "Your base defenses cannot stop my forces, General!"
 tglab036 -  "Aww, General... If you cannot even hold on to your Command
              Center, how do you hope to defeat me?"
 tglab037 -  "So many of your structures have fallen! General, why not
              retreat the field and spare yourself any further
              embarrassment?"
 tglab038 -  "Do not test my patience further by destroying any more of
              my Oil Derricks, General!"
 tglab039 -  "You dare to destroy my Barracks, General?!"
 tglab040 -  "General, I require an Arms Dealer to do my business! Do
              not destroy another one!"
 tglab041 -  "You think you're crushing my defenses, General? More will
              rise in their place!"
 tglab042 -  "That is the last building you will destroy, General! My
              patience has limits!"
 tglab043 -  "My Command Center! You have forced me to retreat
              underground! But this isn't over yet, General!"
 tglab044 -  "You have destroyed many of my machine, General! Perhaps I
              underestimated you..."
 tglab045 -  "My men are not targets for your practice, General! Their
              blood is on your hands!"
 tglab046 -  "Release my Oil Derrick, or I will burn it down!"
 tglab047 -  "I see you've captured that derelict Artillery Platform.
              Best of luck making it work~!"

              all!"
 tglab052 -  "Fool! You have crossed the line! Your forces are forfeit!"

              strategy."

 tglab055 -  "A frontal attack? You should have brought more forces!"
 tglab056 -  "I see you've found my extra supplies... and I stress, MY
              extra supplies! Leave them now!"
 tglab057 -  "Approaching my base from that path will only lead you to
              death!"
 tglab058 -  "Stay out of that village, General! I protect those under
              my care!"
 tglab059 -  "Those resources are for my people, General! They are not
              your for the taking!"
 tglab060 -  "Those buildings were not placed here for your use,
              General! Do not disrupt my infrastructure!"
 tglab061 -  "It seems you appetite has overstretched your resources,
              General! I hope you get your power back up before we reach
              your base!"
 tglab062 -  "Our land is without power! Too bad you depend on it to run
              your base!"
 tglab063 -  "Out of funds, General?"
 tglab064 -  "General, you are taxing my resources! Your little war will
              cause my people to go hungry!"
 tglab065 -  "A SCUD Storm? You have stolen our technology! You will pay
              for this, General!"
 tglab066 -  "Building nuclear weapons, General? I figured you would
              resort to such cowardice!"
 tglab067 -  "Particle Cannon?? Your beams from space cannot reach us
              beneath the earth!"
 tglab068 -  "So many base defenses! You must truly fear my power,
              General!"
 tglab069 -  "How many tanks do you require, General?"
 tglab070 -  "You fill the air with those annoying gnats! Now, we will
              swat them down!"
 tglab071 -  "Train all the men you wish, General, but the loss of life
              will only grow greater by the minute!"
 tglab072 -  "Your base has grown large, General! Perhaps too large?"
 tglab073 -  "Launch your toxins at us, General! We have prepared for
              much worse!"
 tglab074 -  "Everyone, underground!! Their nuclear missiles approach!"
 tglab075 -  "Yes, use your particle beam! Show the world your
              cowardice!"
 tglab076 -  "Garrison the building, General! Hide like rats in a wall!"
 tglab077 -  "Colonel Burton will not save you, General! You'll have to
              fight this war yourself!"
 tglab078 -  "Ah, the beautiful Black Lotus... Join me, Lotus, and you
              could live... as a queen!"
 tglab079 -  "Jarmen Kell? He dares to stand against me? My vengeance
              will be most... unpleasant!"
 tglab080 -  "Your Airfield will not stand against my assault, General!"
 tglab081 -  "Ohh... finally built a War Factory, eh General? What took
              you so long?"
 tglab082 -  "Your pathetic Barracks will be of NO use to you, General!"
 tglab083 -  "Selling off your buildings to fund your army? Hardly seems
              logical, does it, General?"
 tglab084 -  "This is impossible! You cannot defeat me!?"                 >> search your feelings, you know it to be true...
 tglab085 -  "You may think you have the upper hand, but this battle
              will turn like the wind!"
 tglab086 -  "Your soldiers may outnumber mine now, but battles are won
              by more than numbers, General!"
 tglab087 -  "I can't believe that I'm being beaten by such a weak-
              minded fool! The shame will mark me forever!"
 tglab088 -  "Defeated by a fool... The humiliation is too great to
              bear... Please, leave me to my torment!"
 tglab089 -  "General, I smell the stench of fear and desperation coming
              from you base!"
 tglab090 -  "Haha! I sense the time of your demise growing near,
              General!"
 tglab091 -  "Your forces are beginning to be overrun, General! Soon
              they will be my prisoners!"
 tglab092 -  "We are kicking you like a wounded goat, General! Admit
              defeat to spare your agony!"
 tglab093 -  "You are defeated! This is what happens to all who stand
              against me, General!"
 tglab094 -  "You are a fool to challenge me, General!"
 tglab095 -  "All the powers of the GLA are at my disposal!"
 tglab096 -  "I am more dangerous than all my three Generals combined!"
 tglab097 -  "You have won, General! Why do you continue to torture me
              by examining these statistics?"
 tglab098 -  "Yes, you can see now why you have lost! The numbers speak
              for themselves, hahahaha!"
 tglab099 -  "You have traveled far, and faced many opponents to reach
              me, General!"
 tglab100 -  "I commend your efforts, but they have wholly unprepared
              you for what you are about to face!"
 tglab101 -  "You have faced Dr. Thrax's toxic warriors, Kassad's
              stealth legions, and Juhziz's demolitions... but I taught
              them ALL in the art of war!"
 tglab102 -  "This will be your final battle, General! May whatever gods
              you pray to have mercy on you... because I will not!"
 tglab103 -  "This will be your final battle, General! Make your peace
              and prepare for the end!"
 tglab104 -  (laughing) "Hehahahahahahaha..."
 tglab105 -  (laughing) "Khuhuhuhuahahahahaha!"

 tinfa001 -  "So, this is where you're hiding, General!"
 tinfa002 -  "Hehe... Feeling overwhelmed General?"
 tinfa003 -  "1 billion more where that came from!"
 tinfa004 -  "Like a SWARM of locusts, they descend from the sky, to
              devour all those who stand against China!"
 tinfa005 -  "Ever been hacked General? Hehahah hahahahahaha!"
 tinfa006 -  "March!"
 tinfa007 -  "They make good shields too..."
 tinfa008 -  "Here's a tip General, Surrender!"
 tinfa009 -  "Don't worry General, we don't take prisoners!"
 tinfa010 -  "UNLEASH THE HORDE!"                                      >> ...THE KRAKEN! and other monsters as well!
 tinfa011 -  "It's okay, General, we've brought our own flag for your
              base!"
 tinfa012 -  "Soon all your men will see are boots marching over them!"
 tinfa013 -  "CHARGE!!"
 tinfa014 -  "Death to all who oppose us!"
 tinfa015 -  "Do you know how hard it is to feed a horde, General?"
 tinfa016 -  "I have enough men to hold a parade! Can we have it in...
              your base? Heh hehahahaha!"
 tinfa017 -  "Are you still here, General?"
 tinfa018 -  "Are you just going to sit there and wait to be overrun?"
 tinfa019 -  "Are your resources getting low, General?"
 tinfa020 -  "How long does it take for you to build your little tank
              force?"
 tinfa021 -  "What tactic will you amaze me with now, General?"
 tinfa022 -  "This can't be the best you can do, General!"
 tinfa023 -  "So far, I'm not impressed, General!"
 tinfa024 -  "You were not prepared for this challenge, were you,
              General?"
 tinfa025 -  "I have enough men to crush you without firing a shot!"
 tinfa026 -  "We are coming for you, General!"
 tinfa027 -  "Aww... we've knocked over your little Tech Building...
              Boo-hoo~!"
 tinfa028 -  "Now your Barracks is gone! How will you fight without
              men?"
 tinfa029 -  "Without a War Factory you'll have to fight me man-to-man,
              General! HUEHUEHEHEHE!"
 tinfa030 -  "No more planes for you! Get on the ground and fight like a
              man!"
 tinfa031 -  "My men are marching right through you base defenses,
              General!"
 tinfa032 -  "There is only empty ground where your Command Center once
              stood, General! Hehe hehahahaha!!"
 tinfa033 -  "I have lost many men, General, but the cost to your
              buildings has been worth it!"
 tinfa034 -  "Leave my Tech Buildings alone, General!"
 tinfa035 -  "NO! Not my Barracks! We will build another, General...
              then you will pay!"
 tinfa036 -  "My War Factory is not essential to my victory, but DO NOT
              destroy another!"
 tinfa037 -  "You have destroyed my Airfield! This is getting annoying,
              General!"
 tinfa038 -  "Destroy all the base defenses you want! They're only there
              to slow you down anyway..."
 tinfa039 -  "You have cost me many buildings, General! My men are
              coming to collect repayment!"
 tinfa040 -  "NO! They destroyed my Command Center! Go get them! Keep
              them away from me!"
 tinfa041 -  "Swat all the planes you like, General! We'll make more!"
 tinfa042 -  "My vehicles are not for your target practice, General!"
 tinfa043 -  "There are many more in my army ready to sacrifice for
              China, General! You won't stop us!"
 tinfa044 -  "I see you've captured my Oil Derrick, General! We are
              coming to take back China's oil NOW!"
 tinfa045 -  "That old Artillery Platform is destroyed, General! You'll
              never get it to work."
 tinfa046 -  "Do you think that Oil Refinery is just there for anyone to
              use? Return the Refinery to me now!"
 tinfa047 -  "You get any closer to my base and I'll set the horde out
              on you!"
 tinfa048 -  "I warn you, General... get away from my base! Do you know
              what a hundred men can do to a tank?!"
 tinfa049 -  "They're in our base! Kill them! Get them out of here!"
 tinfa050 -  "They're getting too close! Protect me!"
 tinfa051 -  "General, get away from my resources... My men need those!"
 tinfa052 -  "General, do not try to flank my base!"
 tinfa053 -  "A backdoor attack will not help you, General!"
 tinfa054 -  "Attacking the front of my base is foolish, General!"
 tinfa055 -  "Those are my Tech Buildings, General! Stay away!"
 tinfa056 -  "Get out of my buildings, General!"
 tinfa057 -  "Crossing that bridge is a mistake, General!"
 tinfa058 -  "You've run out of power, General! Your defenses are down
              and my men will invade soon!"
 tinfa059 -  "Without power you'll never stop my horde, General!"
 tinfa060 -  "You've wasted all your resources fighting my men... but I
              still have MORE men! Mmhmm..mwahahahaha!"
 tinfa061 -  "We are out of resources? How did this happen??"
 tinfa062 -  "Build your SCUD Storm! It will only hit a few of my men,
              the rest will destroy you!"
 tinfa063 -  "I thought nuclear missile were not allowed! This is hardly
              fair, General..."
 tinfa064 -  "That Particle Cannon is useless against my horde!"
 tinfa065 -  "Yes, you should build more base defenses! At least then
              you can stop the first wave of the charging horde!"
 tinfa066 -  "Coward! You know that your tanks cannot crush my men,
              hahaha, don't you?"
 tinfa067 -  "So many planes...! No matter, my horde and bring down your
              planes too."
 tinfa068 -  "You're mobilizing a horde of your own?? You will need many
              more men to match my strength, General...!"
 tinfa069 -  "You base has grown too large, General! It's time for my
              men to drop in and capture a few for China!"
 tinfa070 -  "SCUD Storm! Scatter!!"
 tinfa071 -  "Nuclear missile approaching! FLEE! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!"      >> 10/10 Best Voice Acting -IGN
 tinfa072 -  "Ooh, look at the pretty light show...! What do you hope to
              accomplish with that petty weapon, General?"
 tinfa073 -  "Get out of that building, General! We have ways of
              bringing you out by force if necessary!"
 tinfa074 -  "You've brought Colonel Burton to our little war, General!
              Even he will fall when faced with the horde!"
 tinfa075 -  "Black Lotus? How will she help you survive my horde,
              General?"
 tinfa076 -  "All forces beware! Jarmen Kell is hiding in the field!"
 tinfa077 -  "I see that Airfield, General. Run to the air! Fear my
              horde!"
 tinfa078 -  "My men will tear your tanks apart as fast as you can make
              them, General!"
 tinfa079 -  "My men are trained in groups of three. How fast can you
              train your men?"
 tinfa080 -  "Selling your buildings? HAHAHA! Foolish! What will you
              buy with the money to stop my horde?"
 tinfa081 -  "I have so many forces... how can you be winning this
              battle?"
 tinfa082 -  "Hmph, I have underestimated your tactics, General."
 tinfa083 -  "You have caught me off guard, General! But now I am ready
              for you!"
 tinfa084 -  "You will not defeat my horde, General! Your current
              advantage will soon be lost!"
 tinfa085 -  "I do not accept this defeat, General... My men will cover
              my escape and we will fight another day!"
 tinfa086 -  "My men outnumber you now, General! It would be wise to
              surrender!"
 tinfa087 -  "If you do not retreat now, I will unleash the horde to
              scrape you from our land!"
 tinfa088 -  "This looks like the end for you, General!"
 tinfa089 -  "Do you feel the end drawing near, General? Hehahahahaha!"
 tinfa090 -  "I...'ve defeated you! Now you must choose to join my horde
              or die! Hehe, hehahahahahaha!"
 tinfa091 -  "It's time to unleash the horde!"
 tinfa092 -  "Face me, and fall like the rest!"
 tinfa093 -  "My men will crush you!"
 tinfa094 -  "We will tear through you like locusts!"
 tinfa095 -  "Men? Where are my men?? You wouldn't consider letting me
              go, would you? Please don't hurt me..."
 tinfa096 -  "We have nice uniforms in the horde! It won't be so bad,
              you might even like it! Hehe, but I doubt it. HEHAHAHAHA!"
 tinfa097 -  "Are you ready to face my horde, General?"
 tinfa098 -  "And think... this is just the first wave! HEHAHAHAHA!"
 tinfa099 -  (laughing) "Hmm...HMM...HEHEHAHAHAHAHA!"
 tinfa100 -  (laughing) "HEHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
 tinfa101 -  (laughing) "He..hahahahahaha!"
 tinfa102 -  (laughing out loud) "Hehe, HEHE, HAHA, AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"

 tlase001 -  "I have you in my sights now, General!"
 tlase002 -  "Precision attack commencing!"
 tlase003 -  "Interesting choice of tactics... Didn't help my last
              opponent either."
 tlase004 -  "I'm about to attack! ...I thought you could use the
              warning..."
 tlase005 -  "Maybe you should re-evaluate your strategies. They
              obviously don't work!"
 tlase006 -  "How do you like my new toys, General?"
 tlase007 -  "Prepare yourself, General, you're about to be taught a
              lesson in war!"
 tlase008 -  "Easy come, easy go!"                                  >> LITTLE HIGH, LITTLE LOW!
 tlase009 -  "Khuhuhuhuhu, Maybe you're not cut out for this. Try
              painting."
 tlase010 -  "Beautiful aren't they, General?"
 tlase011 -  "My lasers will cut through your defenses like a hot knife
              through butter!"
 tlase012 -  "Checkmate!"
 tlase013 -  "It's a whole new age of warfare, General, and it's coming
              to your doorstep!"
 tlase014 -  "Target is painted! All forces begin attack run!"
 tlase015 -  "Originally all my weapons also had laser targeting, but
              my enemies got confused... Hahahaha."
 tlase016 -  "Don't look directly at the laser, you could burn out...
              the back of your head! Huehuehue..."
 tlase017 -  "Charging lasers! Please wait, General."
 tlase018 -  "Lasers must be calibrated precisely, for maximum effect."
 tlase019 -  "Dozers, build more Reactors! Lasers take a lot of power."
 tlase020 -  "Can you match fifty million megajoules of lasing power,
              General?"
 tlase021 -  "Looks like a big space battle, doesn't it?"
 tlase022 -  "My lasers are going to turn your armor to vapor!"
 tlase023 -  "General, you should really try to coordinate your attacks!
              This has been all to easy for me!"
 tlase024 -  "Don't get distracted by the pretty lights, General!"
 tlase025 -  "Would you like me to... beam you up, General? Hehehehe..."   >> :kappa:
 tlase026 -  "Your weapons can't match my pinpoint accuracy, General!
              Why not just surrerend?"
 tlase027 -  "Why don't you build another Barracks, General? I'll enjoy
              destroying that one too!"
 tlase028 -  "If you can't protect your War Factory, how safe could your
              Command Center be?"
 tlase029 -  "Your planes are not safe from my lasers, especially
              without your Airfield!"
 tlase030 -  "Your base defenses are worthless against me!"
 tlase031 -  "Ah, the Command Center, queen of this chessboard! This
              match is all but over now, General!"
 tlase032 -  "My lasers have destroyed so many of your buildings, how do
              you keep fighting? Hehehehe..."
 tlase033 -  "General, don't destroy my Tech Buildings, I need those!"
 tlase034 -  "Get away from my Barracks!"
 tlase035 -  "My War Factory! No!"
 tlase036 -  "How dare you destroy my Airfield!"
 tlase037 -  "They're destroying our defenses! All forces, defend the
              base!"
 tlase038 -  "General, these losses are unacceptable! I'll repay you for
              destroying my buildings!"
 tlase039 -  "No! Quickly! Dozers, rebuild the Command Center!"
 tlase040 -  "General, if you bring down any more of my planes I'll use
              all my Superweapons to destroy you!"
 tlase041 -  "Leave my vehicles alone, General!"
 tlase042 -  "You're hunting my men on purpose, aren't you, General?"
 tlase043 -  "Reap the rewards from that Oil Derrick while you can!
              We'll be there to take it soon!"
 tlase044 -  "That Artillery Platform is no match for my airborne
              lasers!"
 tlase045 -  "Did you know that the Oil Refinery will let you build
              vehicles faster and more efficiently? Ooh, I probably
              shouldn't have told you that..."
 tlase046 -  "You've tripped our outer perimeter warning lasers,
              General! We know you're there now!"
 tlase047 -  "I see you approaching my base, General! I wouldn't advise
              coming any closer."
 tlase048 -  "The enemy is in our base! All forces return and deploy
              lasers!"
 tlase049 -  "Get away from my Reactors, General!"
 tlase050 -  "General, those resources are for me! Stay away from them!"
 tlase051 -  "Attacking from the flanks, eh? It will take more than
              tactical tricks to beat me!"
 tlase052 -  "Flanking attacks?! Oh you ARE devious, General!"
 tlase053 -  "Yes, come straight through my front door, General, if you
              dare!"
 tlase054 -  "Be careful, General, the backdoor of my base isn't so
              undefended as it seems!"
 tlase055 -  "You are foolish to come here, General!"
 tlase056 -  "These resources are not enough to save your failed
              strategy, General!"
 tlase057 -  "No! Stay away! I need those Reactors to power my lasers!"
 tlase058 -  "Out of power? How could you let your base run out of
              power?"
 tlase059 -  "Running out of power is a fatal mistake, General!"
 tlase060 -  "You're out of resources, General! You'll never recover
              before we overrun you!"
 tlase061 -  "Out of resources?? This is unacceptable! Chinooks, gather
              faster!"
 tlase062 -  "Sell that SCUD Storm, General, or I'll destroy it for
              you!"
 tlase063 -  "That Nuke Silo won't stop me, General"
 tlase064 -  "If you build a Particle Cannon and I destroy it with a
              Particle Beam... is that irony?"
 tlase065 -  "That excessive amount of base defenses will only slow
              down my laser, General!"
 tlase066 -  "Your conventional tanks are no match for my laser based
              weapons platforms, General!"
 tlase067 -  "That's quite a lot of planes, General! Are you putting on
              an air show?? Hehehahahaha!"
 tlase068 -  "Quite a few infantry you've trained there, General!
              I can't wait to see this crazy plan!"
 tlase069 -  "Your base is starting to look like a housing tract,
              General! Maybe I should play some Connect The Dots with
              the Particle Cannon to thin your numbers a bit,
              hehehehehehe!"
 tlase070 -  "I will shoot those SCUD missiles down, General! Then you
              will pay!"
 tlase071 -  "My lasers will bring that nuke down, General! The fallout
              will be on your hands..."
 tlase072 -  "Particle Cannon?! I wonder what would happen if we crossed
              the beams..."
 tlase073 -  "General, don't garrison that building! Come out and play!"
 tlase074 -  "General, Colonel Burton is a bumbling fool!"
 tlase075 -  "Black Lotus is not invisible to my lasers, General!"
 tlase076 -  "I hope Jarmen Kell isn't using a laser scope on his rifle~
              It wouldn't work against me."
 tlase077 -  "Building an Airfield only provides airborne targets for my
              lasers, General!"
 tlase078 -  "You're going to need a lot of tanks to get to me, General.
              Good luck!"
 tlase079 -  "Building a Barracks will only get your men hurt, General!"
 tlase080 -  "Selling off your structures, eh? That the first mistake of
              a desperate General!"
 tlase081 -  "What? You can't be beating me!! Your lack of precision
              alone should ensure my victory!"
 tlase082 -  "I can't lose to you...!! You're a bumbling buffoon!"
 tlase083 -  "How can you be winning? This isn't how it played out in
              the simulation!"
 tlase084 -  "I've calculated every variable, yet you're winning. How is
              this possible...?"
 tlase085 -  "No...! This can't be the end! What trickery did you use to
              beat me?"
 tlase086 -  "My planning a preparation is leading me to a clear
              victory!"
 tlase087 -  "Precision will always defeat brute force, General!"
 tlase088 -  "This must be like a nightmare for you, General?"
 tlase089 -  "Have you decided how you are going to accept this defeat,
              General?"
 tlase090 -  "You are defeated, General! But then that was never really
              in question, was it?"
 tlase091 -  "Lasers charged! Tracking targets NOW!"
 tlase092 -  "You're not in my class, General! Try an easier opponent!"
 tlase093 -  "I calculate that you will lose this battle, General!"
 tlase094 -  "Lasers make superior weapons!"
 tlase095 -  "You defeated me, General! But I will scan your tactics and
              devise a superior strategy!"
 tlase096 -  "Your weaknesses became obvious when I scanned your
              tactics!"
 tlase097 -  "There you go, General! I've drawn the line in the sand!"
 tlase098 -  "Now I dare you to cross it! Come and get me, General!
              Khuhuhuhuhu..."

 Tsing Shi Tao

 tnuke001 -  "At least it's a dry heat, General, Hohohohoho..."
 tnuke002 -  "Soon your base will glow like the sun!"
 tnuke003 -  "How do you expect to fight this, General?"
 tnuke004 -  "Your weapons are no match for my powah!"
 tnuke005 -  "Melt! Everything must melt!!"
 tnuke006 -  "THE GLOW...! The wonderful glow...!! Can you not see it,
              General??"                                                 >> one of the most memorable quotes in the entire franchise
 tnuke007 -  "It looks like a nuclear winter this year, General!"
 tnuke008 -  "The end is near, General!"
 tnuke009 -  "This is only the beginning, General... The beginning of
              the end. Ngehehehehe!"
 tnuke010 -  "Don't worry, General, the warheads are on their way!"
 tnuke011 -  "Sorry for the delay, General, just gathering my forces."
 tnuke012 -  "Is the heat getting to you, General?"
 tnuke013 -  "Oh, maybe you are having a meltdown, huh?"
 tnuke014 -  "All forces, prepare for the next assault!"
 tnuke015 -  "Now where did I put those launch codes?"
 tnuke016 -  "Are you ready for more, General?"
 tnuke017 -  "Ohh, I think this is your half-life, General! Hah!"
 tnuke018 -  "I hope your radar isn't down, General! I'd hate for you to
              miss what's coming next~!"
 tnuke019 -  "I know your weaknesses now, General! The next attack will
              be unstoppab-hohohoo-"
 tnuke020 -  "Soon, you will know the glory of my nuclear arsenal!"
 tnuke021 -  "Oh you better bring a lot of sunblock with you, General!"
 tnuke022 -  "No nukes? Who could think of such a thing?"
 tnuke023 -  "Eventually someone must win the arms race, or else, what
              is the point of racing, huh?"
 tnuke024 -  "Time to put on your lead underwear~!"
 tnuke025 -  "Remember! Don't look directly at the blast, General!"
 tnuke026 -  "It appears you have only trained your men to die,
              General!"
 tnuke027 -  "Now your War Factory is a GLOW crater!"
 tnuke028 -  "Your defenses crack like so many eggshells, General..."
 tnuke029 -  "Aiya! You were not inside that Command Center, were you,
              General??"
 tnuke030 -  "Why you destroy my Barracks, General? It is not my men you
              should fear!"
 tnuke031 -  "Aah!! My War Factory! What have you done?! My precious
              tanks... gone!"
 tnuke032 -  "D'oh! Leave me alone! What have I ever done to you?"
 tnuke033 -  "Argh! My Command Center!! NO!! I won't lose command!
              I won't!"
 tnuke034 -  "Agh! I cannot believe you are beating me! Perhaps, you
              would give me a moment to.. rebuild?"
 tnuke035 -  "Oh we have suffered great loses at your hands, General,
              but this isn't over yet!"
 tnuke036 -  "General, you can have that Oil Derrick, but it will not
              help you stop me."
 tnuke037 -  "Gah! Get out of my base, General! I will not ask you
              twice!"
 tnuke038 -  "How long were you planning on stay in my base, General?
              Maybe I should prepare a bunk for you?"
 tnuke039 -  "Leave my base, General, or I will be forced detonate my
              warheads!"
 tnuke040 -  "Do you like my village, General? Please, make yourself at
              home!"
 tnuke041 -  "Coming to inspect the nukes, General? You can look, but
              don't touch!"
 tnuke042 -  "I'd be careful, General, these nuclear depots tend to
              leak! Hehehe."
 tnuke043 -  "Ahh! Get away from my supplies, General!"
 tnuke044 -  "Oh, General, I would not capture that Oil Derrick if I
              were you. I'll only destroy it."
 tnuke045 -  "Get away from my silos, General!"
 tnuke046 -  "Ho... I see your power is down, General! Should I send you
              some... nuclear energy? Ngohoho hohoho!"
 tnuke047 -  "Ohh, out of funds already, General? You should know war is
              expensive!"
 tnuke048 -  "Yeah, please, build more tanks, General! Even they will
              melt... in time!"
 tnuke049 -  "Keep those planes away from my silos!"
 tnuke050 -  "Ooh, so many soldiers, General. Do they have their
              radiation suits on?"
 tnuke051 -  "How many nukes do you think it will take me to destroy
              that new weapon, General?"
 tnuke052 -  "How many nukes do you think it will take me to destroy
              that new weapon?"
 tnuke053 -  "Selling off buildings? General, if you wanted to clear
              that area I could have done it for you!"
 tnuke054 -  "You cannot stand against my might, General!"
 tnuke055 -  "Surrender! Or do you want the bombing will continue?"
 tnuke056 -  "You are losing this war, General! A few more bombs and
              your base will fall!"
 tnuke057 -  "Might... makes right! Would you not agree, General?"
 tnuke058 -  "And now for my final attack... Hold on, General, you're
              going to like this! Oh wait, no you won't, hahahaha."
 tnuke059 -  "No one will stand against our nuclear arsenal!"
 tnuke060 -  "Challenge me and your base will GLOW like the sun!
              Hahaha hahaha!"
 tnuke061 -  "Soon... you'll be nothing more than nuclear waste!"
 tnuke062 -  "Another moment and I would have reduced you to dust!"
 tnuke063 -  "Ooh... You are lucky to have survived this battle intact!
              Challenge me again, if you dare!"
 tnuke064 -  "Welcome to the party, General! I hope you can excuse the
              mess."
 tnuke065 -  "Now, General, I think you understand why I am known as Shi
              Tao the Nuke!"
 tnuke066 -  "We have been waiting for you, General! Please, accept our
              gifts!"
 tnuke067 -  "More gifts, General! Our generosity is limitless!"
 tnuke068 -  "Now the battle begins in earnest. Prepare yourself,
              General!"
 tnuke069 -  "Cold Fusion is no way to create power, General!"
 tnuke070 -  "It pains me to destroy your reactors, General!"
 tnuke071 -  "You call that a super weapon, General? It breaks like a
              toy!"
 tnuke072 -  "Argh, NO! My warheads! My beautiful warheads!! You will
              pay, General...!"
 tnuke073 -  "That's okay, General, I have more nukes for you..."
 tnuke074 -  "Hey, HEY! Do you know how much that Nuke Silo costs??"
 tnuke075 -  "Okay, General, that's enough! I'm running out of nukes!"
 tnuke076 -  "Why do you want to blow up my nukes anyway, General?"
 tnuke077 -  "Ahh, no! That was my last Nuclear Silo!"
 tnuke078 -  "Ohh, you have destroyed ALL of my Silos! Why, General?
              WHY??"
 tnuke079 -  "I have captured your barracks, General! Perhaps I will
              sell it. Hahahaha!"
 tnuke080 -  "Hah! My men have captured your War Factory! You really
              should have guarded it better."
 tnuke081 -  "Your defenses are weak, General! We have entered your
              base!"
 tnuke082 -  "My forces are in the field, General! Soon, they will roll
              into your base!"
 tnuke083 -  "We have found some supplies~! Soon, we will control ALL of
              the resources!"
 tnuke084 -  "MORE supplies for us! How are you funding your troops,
              General?"
 tnuke085 -  "Red Guard, capture that Oil Derrick!"
 tnuke086 -  "It appears we have used all the supplies in the area.
              I hope you've made other arrangements, General."
 tnuke087 -  "D'oh! What? I'm out of power?? How can I be out of power?
              Someone get me more power! Now!"
 tnuke088 -  "That Ambulance will not save your men from the radiation!"
 tnuke089 -  "A Strategy Center? What strategy could you possibly devise
              to fight me?"
 tnuke090 -  "The Black Market won't sell you anything powerful enough
              to stop me, General!"
 tnuke091 -  "Your propaganda will not turn anyone against my nuclear
              power, General!"
 tnuke092 -  "Oh, look~! I have a nuke ready for you!"
 tnuke093 -  "WOW, two nukes~! Oh, I am pleased!"
 tnuke094 -  "Three nukes! Ah... Oh that is three times the fun!"
 tnuke095 -  "Four nukes! INCREDIBLE!"
 tnuke096 -  "Five nukes! Maybe you want me to send you a clean pair of
              shorts now, huh? AHAHA!"
 tnuke097 -  "General~ If you sell off any more buildings I will win by
              default!"
 tnuke098 -  (laughing) "OHOHO! OHOHOHOHOHOHO..."
 tnuke099 -  (laughing) "Hihi, hihihi hihihi!"
 tnuke100 -  (laughing) "Aahhaaha... Hahahahaaaah..."

 Prince Kassad

 tstea001 -  "Look at what I've found! Hehehehe..."
 tstea002 -  "Here comes my next attack! Try to be ready this time,
              General!"
 tstea003 -  "You can't kill what you can't see~!"
 tstea004 -  "You didn't need those troops anyways."
 tstea005 -  "Sleeping on the job again, huh? Hahahahaha."
 tstea006 -  "Thanks for the new units, they'll prove useful in
              destroying you!"
 tstea007 -  "Watch this! Oh wait... you can't! Khuhuhuhuhu..."
 tstea008 -  "Oh, did you bring your thermal goggles? HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE!"
 tstea009 -  "I think it's time to acquire a new base!"
 tstea010 -  "It was never meant to be, General... Good bye!"
 tstea011 -  "Closing your eyes will not make the pain of defeat any
              easier. Hehehehehe..."
 tstea012 -  "My stealth assassins will make short work of your forces,
              General!"
 tstea013 -  "We will strike like the snake... quick and invisible!"
 tstea014 -  "You will not stand against this attack, General!"
 tstea015 -  "Handsome Generals always win battles!"
 tstea016 -  "You'll never see me until it is too late, General!"
 tstea017 -  "General, perhaps you could introduce me to Black Lotus?
              I'm a great admirer of her... um, of her work."
 tstea018 -  "When it is quiet, you should fear me the most!"
 tstea019 -  "I can't wait for your next attack! General, can we expect
              it today?"
 tstea020 -  "Don't let your senses grow dull, General! You can expect
              my attack any moment now!"
 tstea021 -  "You can't defeat me, General!"
 tstea022 -  "I will attack when you least expect it, General!"
 tstea023 -  "My men are all over the battlefield, General... hidden
              from view, ready to strike!"
 tstea024 -  "Stealth is my ally, and your enemy."
 tstea025 -  "You've lost your Tech Building, General! What shall you
              lose next?"
 tstea026 -  "You could not stop me from destroying you Barracks,
              General! What do you value if not your men?"
 tstea027 -  "Destroying you War Factory was child's play! Your Command
              Center can't be far behind~"
 tstea028 -  "Your planes have lost their Airfield, and YOU have lost
              your advantage, General!"
 tstea029 -  "There is a hole in your defenses, General! Who can say how
              many of my men are on your base right now?"
 tstea030 -  "Your Command Center is gone, General! My victory is all
              but assured!"
 tstea031 -  "I don't relish destroying your buildings, General, but you
              leave me no choice!"
 tstea032 -  "You are targeting my Tech Buildings because you have no
              hope of reaching my base! Heheh."
 tstea033 -  "You have destroyed my Barracks, but we will rebuild and
              those men will be avenged!"
 tstea034 -  "My Arms Dealer will not be pleased that you destroyed his
              depot, General!"
 tstea035 -  "You have destroyed that base defense, General, but that
              just may have allowed my men time to outflank you!"
 tstea036 -  "You've destroyed many of my buildings, but with even one
              factory left I am a dangerous opponent, General!"
 tstea037 -  "Nicely played, General... you've destroyed my Command
              Center. Now I will be forced to fight dirty..."
 tstea038 -  "You're quite adept at discovering my camouflaged vehicles,
              General... I'll consider a new tactic."
 tstea039 -  "Your brutish tactics are costing me men, General! I'll
              reconsider my tactics, now that I know you have none..."
 tstea040 -  "Now that I've captured this Oil Derrick, my forces will
              grow even faster!"
 tstea041 -  "Artillery Platforms are so brutish, but I can't let you
              have it, can I~?"
 tstea042 -  "This Oil Refinery is now mine, General!"
 tstea043 -  "General, you are coming dangerously close to my base!"
 tstea044 -  "I see forces approaching my base, General! You don't mean
              to invade, do you?"
 tstea045 -  "You are testing my patience, General! Remove you forces
              from my base!"
 tstea046 -  "If you do not remove your forces from my base, I will
              remove them permanently!"
 tstea047 -  "So, you're trying to enter my base from the flank! We'll
              put a stop to that!"
 tstea048 -  "A backdoor attack! Ooh... I didn't realize you were so
              DEVIOUS, General!"
 tstea049 -  "A frontal assault? That will prove a fatal mistake,
              General!"
 tstea050 -  "Those are my resources, General! Go find your own!"
 tstea051 -  "Why do you insist on approaching my base that way,
              General?"
 tstea052 -  "That route is not as unguarded as it seems, General!"
 tstea053 -  "The only thing you will find here is your own destruction,
              General!"
 tstea054 -  "What is your fascination with this area, General?"
 tstea055 -  "We are nearing your base, General! There may be crosshairs
              on your head, right now..."
 tstea056 -  "Your outer defenses are weak, General! Let's hope you base
              is better protected!"
 tstea057 -  "We have entered you base, General! Ignore us... at your
              own peril!"
 tstea058 -  "Your defenses are broken, General! How will you repel us
              now?"
 tstea059 -  "You really should be defending these resources, General,
              or this battle will be very short!"
 tstea060 -  "Heheheheh... I've found your Tech Buildings, General! What
              should I do with them?"
 tstea061 -  "I've found the backdoor to your base, General!"
 tstea062 -  "Can you defend against my flanking attack, General? Heh,
              let's find out!"
 tstea063 -  "Only a careless General would allow the power to fail!"
 tstea064 -  "Your power is down, General... You did not plan your
              infrastructure properly. Let's hope it's not a fatal
              mistake, eh."
 tstea065 -  "General, you cannot fight without resources. What will you
              do?"
 tstea066 -  "You have robbed me of my resources, General! Now I will
              return the favor..."
 tstea067 -  "So you have built a SCUD Storm! We will have to deal with
              this new threat..."
 tstea068 -  "Nuclear weapons have no place in this battle, General! Why
              do you insist on building them?"
 tstea069 -  "You would strike at me from space with your cowardly
              Particle Cannon! I am disappointed, General..."
 tstea070 -  "So many base defenses, General. What are you afraid of?"
 tstea071 -  "You're building tanks, are you? Well, a few more sniper
              should take care of that."
 tstea072 -  "More planes, eh? Why so many, General? Afraid to come
              down and face me?"
 tstea073 -  "Let me give you some advice, General! That large group of
              infantry, it is no match for my snipers!"
 tstea074 -  "Your base has grown so large, General! Do you think you
              can defend all your buildings from capture?"
 tstea075 -  "You've launched! You'll regret using that SCUD Storm,
              General!"
 tstea076 -  "Nuclear missiles! I thought you were bluffing, General!"
 tstea077 -  "Yes, look at the cowardly particle beam... Enjoy this,
              General! My answer will be swift and brutal!"
 tstea078 -  "By all means, General, garrison that building! My snipers
              can possibly hit them in there!"
 tstea079 -  "Colonel Burton?? General, perhaps you should make him the
              General. You'll only lead him to an early grave!"
 tstea080 -  "Ah, the beautiful Black Lotus... Perhaps after you're
              defeated, General, she'll agree to join me..."
 tstea081 -  "Jarmen Kell?? All snipers beware, Jarmen Kell has entered
              the field!"
 tstea082 -  "Wise choice building an Airfield! But planes alone will
              not be enough to defeat me, General!"
 tstea083 -  "My spies tell me you've finally built your War Factory,
              General! Are you ready to fight now?"
 tstea084 -  "Train all the men you wish from that Barracks, General!
              They are no match for my snipers!"
 tstea085 -  "You've sold off one of your buildings, eh? Such tactics
              lead to defeat, General!"
 tstea086 -  "How are you defeating my forces?! It's not possible!"
 tstea087 -  "You may have the upper hand now, but your desperate
              tactics will not endure, General!"
 tstea088 -  "My forces will rise up against your oppression and we will
              defeat you, General!"
 tstea089 -  "Enjoy your advantage for now, General! You'll make a
              mistake soon, and I'll turn the tide of this battle!"
 tstea090 -  "So it ends... You've defeated me, General... But someday,
              I'll have my revenge! Watch your back, General!"
 tstea091 -  "Your forces are weakening, General~! Accept defeat and
              I'll go easy on you! I promise."
 tstea092 -  "Hohohoho... Your attacks are ineffective against me,
              General! Soon we'll sweep in and destroy you!"
 tstea093 -  "Yawn... I'm enjoying this little game, General, but your
              pathetic attacks are beginning to bore me!"
 tstea094 -  "I thought you would provide more of a challenge, General!
              I guess I overestimated you..."
 tstea095 -  "You have fallen to Kassad, like all have before you!"
 tstea096 -  "We will strike like the snake, unseen and deadly!"
 tstea097 -  "Now you see me, now you're dead! Hehehehehe..."
 tstea098 -  "I am Kassad!"
 tstea099 -  "This will not go well for you, General!"
 tstea100 -  "My men will not accept this defeat from their leader,
              General! You have signed my death warrant with your
              superior tactics!"
 tstea101 -  "Khuhuhuhu... Accept your bitter defeat and remove yourself
              from my sight, General!"
 tstea102 -  "Hehehehehehe... and another who stood against me falls!"
 tstea103 -  "And so it will be for you, General! No warning, no mercy!"
 tstea104 -  "You still have time to flee with your life, General!
              MWAHAHAHAHAHA..."
 tstea105 -  (laughing) "Khahahahahahaha..."
 tstea106 -  (laughing) "Hehehehehe... Hahahahahaha ha."
 tstea107 -  (dying scream) "Oagghhh...!"

 Ta Hun Kwai (He Very Fast)

 ttank001 -  "I see you haven't run in fear, General! Soon, you'll wish
              you had!"
 ttank002 -  "My forces are at your door, General!"
 ttank003 -  "The Iron Dragon marches through your puny defenses!"
 ttank004 -  "I fear this will end you, General!"
 ttank005 -  "Ooohhh... can you feel the thunderous song of approaching
              armor, General?"
 ttank006 -  "Are you protecting your flanks, General? Why don't we have
              a look..."
 ttank007 -  "Are you impressed with the modifications to my tanks,
              General?"
 ttank008 -  "Armor, crush them!"
 ttank009 -  "Soon the field will fill with tanks... MY tanks!"
 ttank010 -  "All units, attack!"
 ttank011 -  "Nice base, General! Care to surrender it? Mwhahahahaha!"
 ttank012 -  "This spells your DOOM, General!"
 ttank013 -  "We're in your base, General! Your defenses were
              inadequate!"
 ttank014 -  "You DARE attack my War Factory?? All forces, remove this
              pest!"
 ttank015 -  "TANKS...! Build MORE TANKS!!"
 ttank016 -  "Another battalion is on its way, General! Please make them
              feel welcome. Khuhahahaha..."
 ttank017 -  "Ahh... this is the part of the battle I enjoy the most...
              the part just before I finish off my enemy! MWAHAHAHAHA!"
 ttank018 -  "Tanks, move faster, before our opponent considers an
              actual attack! MWHAHA HAHAHA!"
 ttank019 -  "It's quiet out there, General! There must be A LOT of
              tanks rolling towards your base, don't you think?"
 ttank020 -  "I'm going to take this time to construct more defenses...
              no, wait... I'll build more tanks instead! MWAHAHAHAHA!"
 ttank021 -  "This area was once fertile farm land... Soon your blood
              will make it fertile again!"
 ttank022 -  "Your tactics amuse me, General!"
 ttank023 -  "Enjoy the rest, General! Soon the attacks will begin
              again!"
 ttank024 -  "We're awaiting your assault, General~! But I'm beginning
              to wonder if it will ever come..."
 ttank025 -  "Our War Factories are working hard to make more tanks!
              Just for you, General! MWAHAHAHAHA!"
 ttank026 -  "How much longer can you survive such loses, General?
              Perhaps it is time to consider surrender..."
 ttank027 -  "Tanks amass in our base, preparing for the final assault!
              Will your defenses hold this time? Hmm?"
 ttank028 -  "Soon we will remove you from our lands!"
 ttank029 -  "This will be your last chance to prove yourself, General!
              Soon my tanks will end your pitiful army!"
 ttank030 -  "You cannot believe your luck will hold out much longer,
              can you, General?"
 ttank031 -  "Ooh... You didn't want that Tech Building, did you?"
 ttank032 -  "Your Barracks has fallen to my tanks, General~"
 ttank033 -  "There goes your Factory, General!! How will you match my
              armor now?? Hmm? Hahahahaha!"
 ttank034 -  "Without your Airfield you've lost your only chance against
              me, General!"
 ttank035 -  "Your defenses fall like toys before my armor!"
 ttank036 -  "Sigh, you have lost your Command Center and all hope to
              win against me, General! I await your surrender!"
 ttank037 -  "You've lost a lot of buildings, General... Isn't it time
              to surrender?"
 ttank038 -  "That Tech Building was mine, General! You will regret
              destroying it!"
 ttank039 -  "So, you've destroyed my Barracks... so be it! Now I will
              destroy yours!"
 ttank040 -  "We will rebuild that War Factory! Soon the tanks will
              again flow to your base like water!"
 ttank041 -  "Destroying my Airfield will not stop me, General!"
 ttank042 -  "Destroying my defenses only let's me know where you are,
              General! Mwahahaha!"
 ttank043 -  "General, you are destroying an unacceptable number of my
              buildings! This must stop!"
 ttank044 -  "You've destroyed my Command Center. I am impressed,
              General! Few survive this long."
 ttank045 -  "You're shooting at my planes?? Do you think this is the
              best tactic against me, General?"
 ttank046 -  "Enough! Do not destroy any more of my tanks, General!"
 ttank047 -  "OH, STOP targeting my infantry, you coward!"
 ttank048 -  "General, I need that Oil Derrick for my tanks! Release it
              to me or pay!"
 ttank049 -  "That Artillery Platform is no match for my armor,
              General!"
 ttank050 -  "Ah! I see you captured an Oil Refinery! Perhaps I should
              take it from you?"
 ttank051 -  "We are approaching you base, General~! Prepare yourself."
 ttank052 -  "Aaahh, my tanks are almost in range of your base! This
              should be over soon!"
 ttank053 -  "We've breached your defenses, General! Now your factories
              will begin to fall! Hmmhmm hehahahaha..."
 ttank054 -  "Thank you for inviting us into your base, General!"
 ttank055 -  "I see your flank is exposed, General! I expected as much!"
 ttank056 -  "Gasp! There are NO guards at your backdoor! Tsk tsk... A
              fatal mistake on your part, General!"
 ttank057 -  "I see you've built a second base, General! It will soon be
              removed!"
 ttank058 -  "Aaah... I've found your Tech Building! Now... should I
              destroy it, or capture it?"
 ttank059 -  "Your power is down. Your forces are finished~!"
 ttank060 -  "I would suggest restoring your power, General! Before we
              turn it off... permanently!"
 ttank061 -  "Your supply pile looks low! Now nothing can stop us!"
 ttank062 -  "Supplies! I NEED more supplies!"
 ttank063 -  "And what you plan to do with that SCUD Storm, General?"
 ttank064 -  "And now this war has gone nuclear! Excellent!"
 ttank065 -  "That Particle Cannon will never live to fire on me!"
 ttank066 -  "So many base defenses, General! All so useless!"
 ttank067 -  "So, you're trying to match my tanks in the field! I
              question your tactics, General!"
 ttank068 -  "I see many planes, General! Like gnats, waiting to be
              swatted out of the sky!"
 ttank069 -  "Sigh... You have trained too many men, General! They will
              all be crushed beneath my treads!"
 ttank070 -  "Your base has grown too large, General! My tanks will
              enjoy the target practice!"
 ttank071 -  "Your SCUD Storm will harm us! But now you have made me
              angry, General~!"
 ttank072 -  "Only a failed General would resort to nuclear missiles!"
 ttank073 -  "This particle beam will not defeat us, General!"
 ttank074 -  "Yes! Garrison your buildings! You only delay the
              inevitable!"
 ttank075 -  "No one soldier can turn the tide! Not even Colonel
              Burton..."
 ttank076 -  "Ahh, Black Lotus, you grace us with your presence! Perhaps
              you would consider fighting for me?"
 ttank077 -  "All tanks beware! Jarmen Kell has entered the field!"
 ttank078 -  "An Airfield is a wise choice against me, but it won't save
              you from defeat, General!"
 ttank079 -  "Build your War Factories, General! They still will not
              produce tanks capable of stopping mine!"
 ttank080 -  "I see you've built a Barracks, General! Please, try to
              keep your men out from under my tanks! (snorts)"
 ttank081 -  "Yes, sell all of your buildings and flee from the field,
              General! This battle is lost to you!"
 ttank082 -  "You are losing, General! This battle is mine!"
 ttank083 -  "All hope is gone now, General! Surrender, or die!"
 ttank084 -  "General, my forces outnumber yours! This only a matter to
              time now!"
 ttank085 -  "Your inferior strategy has lead you to this place,
              General! You can't win now!"
 ttank086 -  "My victory was assured from the beginning!"
 ttank087 -  "Your tactics have given you a momentary advantage,
              General, but you won't maintain it!"
 ttank088 -  "No! You will not win, General! We will build more tanks
              and defeat you!"
 ttank089 -  "Your cowardly tactics may have gotten you this far, but
              this foolishness ends NOW!"
 ttank090 -  "I think I've let you win long enough, General! Prepare for
              the end!"
 ttank091 -  "Arrrgh! This cannot be!! How have you defeated my tanks?!"
 ttank092 -  "That's it! Time to unleash the war machine!"
 ttank093 -  "Your tank rush is nothing compared to mine!"
 ttank094 -  "Don't challenge my tanks, General! You will lose!"
 ttank095 -  "My armor will crush your pathetic forces!"
 ttank096 -  "You may have defeated my tanks, General, but the Tigress
              will crush you like an insect!"
 ttank097 -  "Tanks are the key to any victory, as you well know!
              Hahahahaha!"
 ttank098 -  "I see you defeated my scouts, General! The next attack
              won't go so well for you, I think..."
 ttank099 -  "Here we come, General~! I hope your defenses are up!"
 ttank100 -  "And these are just my Battlemasters, General! Just wait
              until the Overlord join the battle! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!"         >> but you use Emperor Tanks...
 ttank101 -  "I'd be careful, General... sometimes the Red Guard like to
              take over buildings while you're busy with my tanks!
              H-hahahahaha!"

 ttoxi001 -  "Ha! I see you~~!"
 ttoxi002 -  "One taste, and you'll never go back... even if you wanted
              to!"
 ttoxi003 -  "Have a taste of my own medicine!"
 ttoxi004 -  "Heheh... How long can you hold your breath?"
 ttoxi005 -  "Ready for another chemistry lesson? Heh!"
 ttoxi006 -  "Ooohh... it is not so bad... You should only feel a long
              and painful burning after this!"
 ttoxi007 -  "Toxin troopers, attack!!"
 ttoxi008 -  "Here we come, General, like a chemical spill!"
 ttoxi009 -  "It is so hard to find a doctor these days who will make
              housecalls, aah, but Dr. Thrax still does! KH-HAHA-KHAHA!"
 ttoxi010 -  "OHH! Spill on isle one! HAHAHAHA!!"
 ttoxi011 -  "Like acid rain, we descend upon your base, General!"
 ttoxi012 -  "Go forth, my toxic warriors! Bring our message to the
              masses! Hahah!"
 ttoxi013 -  "Ooohhh... you are going to like this, General! Oh, no
              wait, hehe, no you won't!! HAHAHAHA!"
 ttoxi014 -  "You have brought this on yourself, General! Now, watch
              your men pay for your mistake!"
 ttoxi015 -  "Silent, but deadly!"
 ttoxi016 -  "Ahh... that's right! Sit back and relax! Give my toxins
              more time to work!"
 ttoxi017 -  "The suspense... it's KILLING YOU! HAHAHAHA!"
 ttoxi018 -  "Time to brew another batch!"
 ttoxi019 -  "Hah! Every moment you delay, YOU DIE a little bit more!"
 ttoxi020 -  "See? You can tell they are -Mmhh- just right! When the
              flesh falls off the bone!"
 ttoxi021 -  "Anthrax... it does a body BAD!"
 ttoxi022 -  "You smell something? Huh? HAHAHAHAHA!"
 ttoxi023 -  "Now breathe in... (breaths in) that's it, and out...
              (breaths out) again...! Oh yes, feel better? HEHEHEHEHE!"   >> Congratulations, it's a boy!
 ttoxi024 -  "Hmm! Good to the last drop!"
 ttoxi025 -  "Uhh... I'll give you a breather before our next attack,
              hehe!"
 ttoxi026 -  "Eh... General, we have a clogged toxin nozzle! Give me a
              second to fix it!"
 ttoxi027 -  "You'll come for the toxin, but you'll stay... BECAUSE
              YOU'RE DEAD! HEHEHAHAHA!"
 ttoxi028 -  "You will regret intruding on my experiments, General!"
 ttoxi029 -  "Are you going to attack me, or are you afraid of what you
              might find at my base, huh? Hahahaha!"
 ttoxi030 -  "Nothing can live beneath my toxic cloud, General!"
 ttoxi031 -  "Ah, you didn't really need that anyway. Hahahaha!"
 ttoxi032 -  "Aaahhh... Your troops appear INTOXICATED, General!
              HAHAHAHA!"
 ttoxi033 -  "Ooohhh... General, looks like your troops can't hold their
              toxin!"
 ttoxi034 -  "HAH! Your Airfield is destroyed, General! Now you'll have
              to walk through my clouds of death!"
 ttoxi035 -  "Notice how the toxins tear everything apart? Heheh!"
 ttoxi036 -  "Argh! I had my wine collection in there!!"
 ttoxi037 -  "My toxins and your troops certainly have chemistry, eh?
              Hehehe...."
 ttoxi038 -  "Meh, I didn't need that anyway!"
 ttoxi039 -  "Huh? Now where will my chemical soldiers come from?"
 ttoxi040 -  "Heh! My Toxin Trucks will roll again!"
 ttoxi041 -  "See? People do not belong in the air!"
 ttoxi042 -  "Hmph! You inconvenience me, General!"
 ttoxi043 -  "Stop destroying my buildings, General, or I will make
              things... unpleasant for you!"
 ttoxi044 -  "Hah! You've destroyed my Command Center! Ah well, I always
              hated my Commanders anyway, hehehe! Now... it is just you
              and me, General! Hehehehehe..."
 ttoxi045 -  "General, if you keep destroying my vehicles, how can I
              bring you your medicine? Hehehehehe!"
 ttoxi046 -  "Ughh!! My brave warriors! How can you do this to them??
              What did they ever do to- Oh... no wait, never mind."
 ttoxi047 -  "Gah! Give me back that Oil Derrick! Don't you know
              Petroleum is a key ingredient in my toxins?!"
 ttoxi048 -  "Meh, that Artillery Platform will not stop me, General!"
 ttoxi049 -  "General, I need that Refinery to purify my toxins! What
              could you possibly need it for, huh?"
 ttoxi050 -  "Did I give you permission to come in??"
 ttoxi051 -  "What are you doing in here? The recipes are mine!"          >> Mr. Krabs is that you?
 ttoxi052 -  "Heh! You are a fool to come into my base, General!"
 ttoxi053 -  "Ah, you are too close to my precious toxins, General, and
              for that, you must die!"
 ttoxi054 -  "Stay away from my SCUD missiles! I'll give them to you
              when I'm ready!"
 ttoxi055 -  "Eh, I don't think you want those supplies. Err, they are
              not... ready yet!"
 ttoxi056 -  "Hah! I see you're building another base, eh? Soon, it will
              be abandoned!"
 ttoxi057 -  "Get out of my village, General! Eh, there is not much left
              of it, but it is mine! Hahaha!"
 ttoxi058 -  "Be careful as you cross that bridge, General! The water
              below is not safe for swimming! Hehehehe..."
 ttoxi059 -  "Watch out, General, that bridge might not be safe! But
              then, what is around here, huh? Hehehehe."
 ttoxi060 -  "Do you think you're being clever, sneaking into my
              backdoor??"
 ttoxi061 -  "So, you've made it across the river... Now the battle gets
              interesting!"
 ttoxi062 -  "It looks like you are out of power, General! Perhaps I
              should attack now."
 ttoxi063 -  "You are out of power, General! Now it is time for me to come and play! Hehehehe!"
 ttoxi064 -  "Your resource pile has grown small, General! I don't think
              you have enough to stop my next attack, hehehe!
              Excellent..."
 ttoxi065 -  "Budget? I don't want to hear about the budget!"
 ttoxi066 -  "You dare to build a SCUD Storm in my presence? You know,
              of course, that we are all immune to its toxins, don't
              you, General?"
 ttoxi067 -  "A Nuke Silo? I would not have expected you to use toxic
              radiation... Perhaps we could work together sometime,
              hahahahaha!"
 ttoxi068 -  "So... a Particle Cannon to counter my toxins, eh? Your
              technology is no match for my toxins, General!"
 ttoxi069 -  "So many defenses, General, and all... USELESS!"
 ttoxi070 -  "Hmph! Metal is only a temporary barrier to my toxins!"
 ttoxi071 -  "Heh, coward!! Your pilots still need to breathe~!"
 ttoxi072 -  "Do you enjoy seeing your men glow in the dark, huh? Hehe,
              BUILD MORE, THEN! Heh."
 ttoxi073 -  "Ooh... your base has grown SO large, General! A perfect
              target for my SCUD Storm!"
 ttoxi074 -  "Yes, yes! Fire your SCUD Storm! Visit your useless toxins
              upon my base! Hah!"
 ttoxi075 -  "Nuh-uh-uh! Your nuclear missile will only mutate us AND
              MAKE US STRONGER! Hehehe!"
 ttoxi076 -  "Bah, you cannot hope to clear my toxins with that particle
              beam, General!"
 ttoxi077 -  "Yes, yes! Garrison that building! I'm sure my Toxin
              Tractors will LOVE that!"
 ttoxi078 -  "If you bring Colonel Burton into this, I'll have to
              release Jarmen Kell!"
 ttoxi079 -  "Black Lotus? You know, of course, that the black lotus is
              a poisonous flower! I think that is in one of my toxins,
              hehehe! But I digress..."
 ttoxi080 -  "Huh! I see Jarmen Kell has joined our little war, hehehe!
              Perhaps mine would enjoy a sniper duel!"
 ttoxi081 -  "Aah... What do you want with that Airfield, General?"
 ttoxi082 -  "So, our General builds a War Factory! Pfft... How
              predictable of you!"
 ttoxi083 -  "Yeeesss... Go ahead! Build a Barracks! Send you men to me,
              hehehehe!"
 ttoxi084 -  "Heheh! Sell off all your buildings, General! And send your
              men to me~"
 ttoxi085 -  "Give up now, and I guarantee you'll breathe easy!"
 ttoxi086 -  "Your troops are short of breath, General! Give up!"
 ttoxi087 -  "My second wind spells your doom, General! Heh!"
 ttoxi088 -  "Let me drown your sorrows with a nice toxin!"
 ttoxi089 -  "Toxic Fatality...!"
 ttoxi090 -  "You are defeated, General! Perhaps this will teach you to
              defy Dr. Thrax, HAHA!"
 ttoxi091 -  "Maybe you will consider a peace offering, eh? An antidote,
              perhaps?"
 ttoxi092 -  "Perhaps I've inhaled too many of my own toxins! You can't
              possibly be defeating me!"                                  >> high af
 ttoxi093 -  "Hah! Get away from me! You will not defeat me, General! Do
              you hear me?!"
 ttoxi094 -  "Aww... What do you have against toxins, huh? Have you seen
              what they put in food these days? Ugh!"
 ttoxi095 -  "Even if you defeat me, my toxins will get to you...
              eventually!"
 ttoxi096 -  "No! NO!! Ugh, I am defeated! Now where is that cyanide
              capsule..."
 ttoxi097 -  "That button was covered with poison! You're already dead!     >> HIDEBU!
              Hehehe!"
 ttoxi098 -  "You dare to select Dr. Thrax? You should reconsider,
              General!"
 ttoxi099 -  "Eeehh... You cannot defeat my toxins, General!"
 ttoxi100 -  "Sigh, perhaps I shouldn't have gotten my degree from
              mail-order college..."
 ttoxi101 -  "Ooh... you thought my toxins were ineffective, and NOW
              look what has happened to you, General! HEHEHEHE!"
 ttoxi102 -  "Ahh... greetings, General! Do not think I cannot see your
              spies flying over my base? Please, look all you wish!
              Because this may be the last time you ever see my
              stronghold..."
 ttoxi103 -  "As you can see, my defenses are impenetrable... and my
              toxic weapon systems will poison your troops long before
              they can reach me!"
 ttoxi104 -  "And... do not worry about hurting the civilian population,
              General, they have long since fled this valley of toxic
              death. Our little war will play out uninterrupted, and
              your delicate sensibilities will not be taxed."
 ttoxi105 -  "And here is where you've placed your pathetic base. Hah!
              Now make your stand against me, DOCTOR THRAX, and once
              your forces have breathed their last breath of my toxic
              air, I can return to my experiments!"
 ttoxi106 -  "Do you trust your senses, General? Hehehehehe! By engaging
              me, you have doomed yourself to a long and painful death,
              for I am DOCTOR THRAX, and my weapons strike... unseen!"
 ttoxi107 -  "Breathe easy, General, for I am Dr. Thrax, and with every
              breath you take, you are on your way to defeat!"
 ttoxi108 -  "The first sample is free! Khuhuhu!"
 ttoxi109 -  "Ahh... would you like the green, or the blue? Both are
              equally satisfying! HEHEHEHEHE!"
 ttoxi110 -  "Prepare to tell your 3-eyed grandchildren of your defeat
              this day!"
 ttoxi111 -  "Gah! My precious chemicals! Do you know how long it takes
              to mix those??"
 ttoxi112 -  "More victim- ah, err, I mean, uh, volunteers for my
              experiments! Hahahaha!"
 ttoxi113 -  "Now I have more vehicles to ferry my toxins! HAHAHA! So
              generous of you!"
 ttoxi114 -  "Oh, did I forget to tell you about those? Haha, silly me!
              Watch the mines, General!"
 ttoxi115 -  "Now where did I put those chemical troops, huh?"
 ttoxi116 -  (laughing) "Hehehehehehe!"
 ttoxi117 -  "Bah! You! (gasps)"
 ttoxi118 -  "And here is where you've placed your pathetic base. Hah!

 tturt001 -  "Oh, you're still here, General! I'm impressed by your
              determination! Let's dance!"
 tturt002 -  "That didn't hurt too much, did it?"
 tturt003 -  "The battlefield is a rough place, General!"
 tturt004 -  "Another perfectly executed strike!"
 tturt005 -  "It's all going according to plan."
 tturt006 -  "Everything seems to be going my way!"
 tturt007 -  "How does that feel, General?"
 tturt008 -  "Tactical superiority is key, General! Here, let me show
              you!"
 tturt009 -  "I really don't think you're going to be able to stop this
              next attack, do you?"
 tturt010 -  "Here comes another attack! Oh, and almost all of my
              Generals Powers are ready to go...! Which one do you want
              to see first? Hehehe..."
 tturt011 -  "Is that my Superweapon ready to go? Heh, no, my attacks
              just feel like that!"
 tturt012 -  "All units, attack pattern Alpha! Hahaha, just kidding!
              Who'd call something Alpha?"
 tturt013 -  "Here comes some of my units, General! Would you mind
              helping them gain some veterancy? Haha..."
 tturt014 -  "I rarely send in troops, but you deserve special
              attention, General!"
 tturt015 -  "I warn you not to underestimate me~!"
 tturt016 -  "You may think I'm hiding, but I'm really just planning~!"
 tturt017 -  "Fools rush in, General! I take my time...!"
 tturt018 -  "You don't know what to expect from me, do you?"
 tturt019 -  "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail, General! Think
              about it!"
 tturt020 -  "My greatest super weapon is my brain...! Wouldn't you
              agree, General?"
 tturt021 -  "Come on, General, take your best shot!"
 tturt022 -  "We're waiting for you, General! What's keeping you?"
 tturt023 -  "I've been analyzing you tactics and I'm just amazed... Do
              you even have any tactics, General?"
 tturt024 -  "I'd attack if I were you, General! If you wait then I'll
              just have one more Superweapon to fire at you!"
 tturt025 -  "So, your overall strategy is to bore me off the
              battlefield."
 tturt026 -  "Are you rethinking the wisdom of attacking me, General?"
 tturt027 -  "I've been trying to go easy on you, General, but you're
              starting to annoy me!"
 tturt028 -  "Oh this has been fun, General, but I think it's time to
              end this!"
 tturt029 -  "Maybe we should do this some other time when you're not so
              distracted. At least, I hope that's what's wrong. You did
              say you were a General, right?"
 tturt030 -  "You weren't using that, w-were you?"
 tturt031 -  "Y'know, I just didn't like the look of that Barracks."
 tturt032 -  "Your vehicles are getting on my nerves!"
 tturt033 -  "Stay out of the air, General! You'll be safer on the
              ground..."
 tturt034 -  "Owh... w-was that supposed to keep me out of your base,
              General?"
 tturt035 -  "Wow, you just lost your Command Center! Heh, that's not
              very good, is it?"
 tturt036 -  "There, that's better! Your base was MUCH too cluttered
              before!"
 tturt037 -  "You have no respect for other people's property!"
 tturt038 -  "People, who was supposed to be guarding the Barracks?"
 tturt039 -  "I was using that War Factory!"
 tturt040 -  "Is keeping my Airfield too much to ask?"
 tturt041 -  "Hey y'know, I put that there for a reason!"
 tturt042 -  "Now why did you have to go and destroy all those
              buildings? I had JUST gotten them where I wanted them!"
 tturt043 -  "I don't appreciate that kind of disrespect!"
 tturt044 -  "I built all of those planes for a reason!"
 tturt045 -  "Destroy as many vehicles as you like! See if I care!"
 tturt046 -  "How dare you hurt my soldiers!"
 tturt047 -  "Capturing Oil Derricks, are we? Well... Uh, I'll let you
              have that one."
 tturt048 -  "I didn't need that Artillery Platform anyway..."
 tturt049 -  "Capturing the Refinery? Why, General, I didn't know you
              were so efficiency conscious!"
 tturt050 -  "Who invited you here?"
 tturt051 -  "I don't believe you have the right security clearance to
              be here!"
 tturt052 -  "What gives you the right to be in my base?"
 tturt053 -  "This is my base, get out now!"
 tturt054 -  "Well, don't expect me to be a good hostess!"
 tturt055 -  "I don't appreciate unexpected visitors, General!"
 tturt056 -  "What do you think you're doing here?"
 tturt057 -  "Intruders!"
 tturt058 -  "Your presence is starting to bother me, General!"
 tturt059 -  "Who was supposed to be guarding that area?"
 tturt060 -  "So, you've managed to crack my defenses! I can assure you
              that will not happen again!"
 tturt061 -  "Get out of my base, General! Don't think I'm above
              dropping a particle beam right here!"
 tturt062 -  "It's looking a little dark in your base, General!"
 tturt063 -  "Oof... Did someone forget to pay the electric bill?"
 tturt064 -  "Ooh... You didn't manage your resources very wisely now,
              did you?"
 tturt065 -  "You are pushing me over budget, General!"
 tturt066 -  "How could this have happened?! I had everything planned so
              perfectly!"
 tturt067 -  "Do you think I'm scared of your little SCUD Storm?"
 tturt068 -  "That Nuke Silo doesn't frighten me!"
 tturt069 -  "I appreciate your choice in weaponry, but I'm the only one
              allowed to have a Particle Cannon on this battlefield!"
 tturt070 -  "Is that as secure as your base can be? Is it?"
 tturt071 -  "That's a lot of tanks, General! Have you seen what a
              Particle Cannon can do to a lot of tanks?"
 tturt072 -  "All those planes are just air pollution to me!"
 tturt073 -  "So many troops, General... You weren't actually planning
              to rush me with them were you?"
 tturt074 -  "That's quite a base you have going there, General! Oh, you
              did remember to space out your buildings to avoid weapon
              strikes, right?"
 tturt075 -  "Oh, do you know how long it's gonna take to clean that
              up?"
 tturt076 -  "Get that disgusting radiation out of my base!"
 tturt077 -  "Hey, that's my Particle Cannon! You're not authorized to
              use it!"
 tturt078 -  "Is that a tactical move, or are you just hiding?"
 tturt079 -  "Colonel Burton? Really? Do you think he is going to help
              you?"
 tturt080 -  "Black Lotus? Well, I guess it's just a girl power
              showdown, isn't it?"
 tturt081 -  "Jarmen Kell...! He better stay away from my tanks!"
 tturt082 -  "Nice Airfield, General! Just keep those planes away from
              my Particle Cannon!"
 tturt083 -  "A War Factory! You're seriously going to attack me, aren't
              you? It's about time...!"
 tturt084 -  "GOOD FOR YOU! You can build a Barracks!"
 tturt085 -  "Selling your buildings? Is that part of your going out of
              business sale?"
 tturt086 -  "Oh look, why don't you just give up? I have better things
              I could be doing today..."
 tturt087 -  "Oh... why can't I ever find someone that lasts more than
              5 minutes?"
 tturt088 -  "Looks like you're losing, General! Now what did I say
              about planning to fail?"
 tturt089 -  "Now that's quite a beating you're taking, General... Are
              you really ready for more?"
 tturt090 -  "I'd like to say Good Fight, but clearly your mind wasn't
              in it, General..."
 tturt091 -  "I can't believe you would beat up on a girl like this..."
 tturt092 -  "I need time to think. Go away, General!"
 tturt093 -  "Your tactics are hardly sporting, General! Play nice!"
 tturt094 -  "General, look over there! Someone is capturing your
              buildings! Sigh... not gonna fall for it, huh?"
 tturt095 -  "You know, if you were a gentleman, you'd give me 5 minutes
              to rebuild my defenses."
 tturt096 -  "What? It's over?? Sigh... Well, it was nice dancing with
              you, General! Maybe next time I'll lead..."
 tturt097 -  "My Superweapons are ready, are you?"
 tturt098 -  "You'll never crack my defenses, General!"
 tturt099 -  "Your rush tactics won't work on me!"
 tturt100 -  "Ugh... It's not fair! One more Superweapon and I would've
              beaten you, General! Challenge me again! I dare you..."
 tturt101 -  "I told you you'd never beat my Superweapons, General! Care
              to try again?"
 tturt102 -  "Welcome, General! Are you ready to begin?"
 tturt103 -  "Ooh, what's that sound? Gasp! And look, there's a light in
              the sky! Hmm... I wonder..."
 tturt104 -  "OHOHOHOHOHO! Oh my!"
 tturt105 -  (laughing) "AHAHAHA HA..."
 tturt106 -  "Oh... oh dear... haha, I am sorry, General, but that's
              just how I like to say hello! Well, good luck, General!"
 tturt107 -  "Well, good luck, General..."

 tusab001 -  "Well there you are! Too late to run now, boy!"
 tusab002 -  "I hope you're ready, 'cause we're comin' for ya!"
 tusab003 -  "Set the table, kid, 'cause we're comin' for dinner!"
 tusab004 -  "I've got three things to teach you, kid! How to lose...
              how to cry... and how to die!"
 tusab005 -  "We're comin' to attack soon, so get out all yo white
              flags!"
 tusab006 -  "Here we come, kid... Try not to wet yourself, okay?"
 tusab007 -  "What part of DIE did you not understand?"
 tusab008 -  "Ooh, you're gonna get it now, kid!"
 tusab009 -  "You ready? Huh? 'Cause here comes a tactic you may have
              learned in school! You ready to go back to school?
              HEHEHEHEHE!"
 tusab010 -  "It's time for me to teach you a thing or two about the
              back of my hand!"
 tusab011 -  "You should've run when you had the chance! Now I'm gonna
              teach you the meaning of respect!"
 tusab012 -  "So about your funeral... (snort) Yeah, open casket or
              closed? HAHAHAHAHA!!"
 tusab013 -  "I'm gonna march into your base, and plant my foot IN YOUR
              BUTT, General!"
 tusab014 -  "Here we come, punk! Step aside or get stepped on!"
 tusab015 -  "You call yourself a General... I call you a pain in the
              butt, that's what I call ya!"
 tusab016 -  "This is your idea of strategy? Of tactics? Heh, Tank Blob
              is the best you can come up with? Haha, pathetic, just
              pathetic!"
 tusab017 -  "Yeah, Suzie, I've read Sun Tzu too! Sigh... Greater Enemy?
              Retreat, Smaller Enemy? Attack. Is that all you got for
              me?"
 tusab018 -  "So, where's your army, boy? Or did you just want to bare
              knuckle it? 'Cause I'll slap you down with my bare hands
              if you want! You wanna piece of that, boy?"
 tusab019 -  "You got me out of bed for this? I ought to take you over
              my knee RIGHT NOW!"
 tusab020 -  "I got more medals than you've got teeth, boy, which won't
              be saying much after I get done knockin' them out for ya,
              HAHAHAHA!"
 tusab021 -  "Excuse me, are you putting all of your defenses at the
              front of your base? Heh, you don't think we can go around
              that? Heh, well do ya?"
 tusab022 -  "Boy, you think I'm playing with you?! You better think
              again!"
 tusab023 -  "Yup, uhh, better check your flanks there, pardner! I, uhh,
              think some of my troops just snuck into your base.
              Hahahahaha..."
 tusab024 -  "Do you think this is a game? Well do ya? ...Wait, don't
              answer that..."
 tusab025 -  "Kid, lemme ask ya question. (snort) Who taught you
              military tactics? Huh? 'Cause you should go slap him
              square in the mouth, I tell ya!"
 tusab026 -  "I got me the whole United States military behind me, son!
              And we've just decided uh... We don't like you!"             >> you must be experienced in gorilla warfare!
 tusab027 -  "Is this tactic of yours supposed to be some kind of joke
              I'm not aware of?"
 tusab028 -  "So, you're not a real General, are you? You're like the
              Surgeon General or something like that, right?"
 tusab029 -  "Does mommy know you're out by yourself? HEHAHAHAHAHA!"
 tusab030 -  "You can- You can tell me, we're just Generals here... Do
              your men know that you're incompetent?"
 tusab031 -  "Did you know you just lost a Tech Building, Sport?"
 tusab032 -  "Just blew up your Barracks, Skippy! Whatchu gonna do about
              it?"
 tusab033 -  "There goes your War Factory! Ya mad yet, boy?"
 tusab034 -  "I dunno why you bothered to build that Airfield if you
              aren't gonna protect it."
 tusab035 -  "Huh, who put these base defenses down like this? Oh, they
              can't defend anything like that!"
 tusab036 -  "I should let you build another Command Center just so I
              could knock it down again!"
 tusab037 -  "I feel like I'm kicking over sand castles. How many of
              your buildings you gonna let me destroy there, Sport?"
 tusab038 -  "I let ya have that Tech Building, Skippy! (snort) I don't
              need it to beat you!"
 tusab039 -  "Kid, that Barracks was NOT a military target! You do that
              again, and this is gonna get ugly!"
 tusab040 -  "You better stand down, son! I'm not gonna stand for you
              blowing up my War Factories, you hear?"
 tusab041 -  "Do you know how much those jets cost? I coulda fed the
              whole world with what you just destroyed!"
 tusab042 -  "Crackin' my defenses, huh? Well, go on~! It should be just
              enough time to overrun your base!"
 tusab043 -  "That's enough buildings, son! Why don't you try attacking
              my forces now?"
 tusab044 -  "My Command Center?! You think I'm just gonna sit here and
              take that?"
 tusab045 -  "You had best leave my Pilots alone, boy! Planes are one
              thing, but you let my Pilots return safe, you hear?"
 tusab046 -  "You're a sneaky little 'cuss, aren't cha? But I think
              that's enough of my vehicles destroyed, don't you?"
 tusab047 -  "Let's get armor and air support out there! Our grunts are
              getting torn apart!"
 tusab048 -  "Let that Oil Derrick go, boy! This war ain't about the
              price of gas you know!"
 tusab049 -  "Think you know how to use that Artillery Platform, son?"
 tusab050 -  "That Oil Refinery is not a viable target, son! And it
              don't belong to you, so we're comin' to get it back!"
 tusab051 -  "Well, well, well... You managed to get to my side of the
              map! Didn't think ya had it in ya!"
 tusab052 -  "You uh, planning to attack, or are you just gonna stand
              there all day?"
 tusab053 -  "You'll get out of my base if you know what's good for you,
              boy!"
 tusab054 -  "Enemy's in our perimeter! All forces repel the invaders!"
 tusab055 -  "Those ain't your supplies, Sport! Best to step off now,
              before you get hurt!"
 tusab056 -  "A flanking attack? Heh, don't make me laugh, boy!"
 tusab057 -  "Tryin' to attack from my backdoor? Heh, good luck with
              that!"
 tusab058 -  "You uh, comin' to attack me, boy? Well it's nice to see ya
              have some guts!"
 tusab059 -  "Get away from my Tech Buildings if you know what's good
              for ya!"
 tusab060 -  "My forces have your base in sight, kid! Whatchu gonna do
              now?"                                                        >> whatchu gonna do when they come for you~!

              wait to see this strategy!"

              postpone this fight!"
 tusab072 -  "You're out of resources? Heh, boy, you don't start the
              dance if you can't pay the bill!"
 tusab073 -  "Uh-oh, looks like we're gonna have to do some deficit
              spending!"
 tusab074 -  "Built yourself a SCUD Storm there... Hah! You can't hit
              the side of a barn with a SCUD, don't chu know that?"
 tusab075 -  "Bringing out your nukes, huh? If Washington hadn't tied my
              hands, I'd show you some nukes, I tell ya!"

              off you, boy"

 tusab081 -  "That's a lot of buildings, son! You know that buildings
              can't fight for you, right?"
 tusab082 -  "Bring the SCUDs, punk! I'll show you the storm!"
 tusab083 -  "You're gonna regret nukin' me, kid! I don't take too
              kindly to that!"
 tusab084 -  "Using a particle beam, eh? You better put me away with
              that because you're not gonna like my counterattack!"
 tusab085 -  "Only a coward fights from inside buildings! You know that,
              right?"
 tusab086 -  "Welcome, Colonel Burton... Sorry you had to get tied up in
              this thing. No hard feelings."

              anywhere near my base!"

              of snipers!"

              air! Might be your only shot at stopping me..."
 tusab090 -  "Only one War Factory? Heh, it's gonna take at least half a
              dozen to stop me, kid!"
 tusab091 -  "Is that Barracks a little close to the frontlines, kid?
              Hard to sleep with bullets in your barracks, y'know!"
 tusab092 -  "Don't just sell one building, boy! Sell them all, and hope
              that I don't come for you anyway!"
 tusab093 -  "Don't get cocky, boy! This ain't over yet!"

              tricks left in me! You'll see..."

              took me down a peg or two!"

              'cause uh, you sure ain't no General..."

 xc1ove01 -  "We will win this day...! Everyone advance...!"


 Red Guard:

 xc1re101 -  "The missiles are prepared, and ready for launch! Final
              countdown started!"
 xc1re102 -  "GLA survivors are running to town for cover! They must be
              stopped!"
 xc1re103 -  "No GLA will slip past our garrison!"
 xc1re104 -  "Toxin Tractors! They're trying to poison us all! We need
              support!!"
 xc1re105 -  "Look, Oil Derricks! Should we capture them?"


 Chinese EVA:

 xc1xoc01 -  "I did not think the United States would be defeated so
              easily..."
 xc1xoc02 -  "I do not understand why the United States has allowed this
              to happen."
 xc1xoc03 -  "This cannot be allowed to stand! China will make things
              right!"
 xc1xoc04 -  "The GLA's treacherous use of our resources against the
              Americans has caused great embarrassment to China! They
              must pay for their insolence!"
 xc1xoc05 -  "3... 2... 1... Missiles are away!"                        >> AND LIFT-OFF!
 xc1xoc06 -  "They believe they have won the day, but they celebrate...
              too soon."
 xc1xoc07 -  "It is pretty, when used for the right reasons..."
 xc1xoc08 -  "General, the GLA managed to defeat the US forces in this
              area. We launched a devastating counterattack, but like
              roaches, they are still alive..."
 xc1xoc09 -  "Even now the GLA survivors are rebuilding..."
 xc1xoc10 -  "To finally eliminate the GLA we must send in our forces
              and root them out of every dark corner in which they
              hide!"
 xc1xoc11 -  "General, our new Listening Outposts are stationed in the
              area! They are at your disposal!"
 xc1xoc12 -  "The Listening Outpost itself is unarmed, however its
              passengers can fire on enemies that venture too close. You
              will find its long sight range and stealth ability greatly
              enhances battlefield awareness."
 xc1xoc13 -  "General, our former base in the region was overrun by the
              GLA. You will need to construct a new base before you can
              engage the enemy!"
 xc1xoc14 -  "May I suggest that you garrison several of the nearby
              buildings to defend our base?"
 xc1xoc15 -  "General, the GLA has garrisoned several buildings
              throughout the town! Perhaps you could use a Dragon Tank
              to clear out those garrisons."
 xc1xoc16 -  "General, the GLA is moving Toxin Tractors towards our
              garrisoned buildings! If those Tractors attack those
              buildings, everyone inside will be eliminated!"
 xc1xoc17 -  "The GLA are using these Oil Derricks to fund their forces!
              One of our Red Guard could capture those Derricks. The
              proceeds would help defeat the GLA."
 xc1xoc18 -  "General, is it wise to destroy these Oil Derricks? They
              would provide valuable resources for us! One of our Red
              Guard could capture them!"
 xc1xoc19 -  "You have caught them off guard, General! One of your Red
              Guard could capture their buildings before they are able
              to respond!"
 xc1xoc20 -  "Now that you have reestablished our base of operations, it
              is time to root out all remaining GLA forces in the area!"
 xc1xoc21 -  "Congratulations, General! You have freed the town of all
              GLA forces! Once you have wiped out their final base, your
              mission will be complete!"

 Defending the Fire

 Battlemaster:

 xc2bat01 -  "They're trying to get to the storage bunkers! Protect them
              at all costs!"
 xc2bat02 -  "They're trying to get to the main Reactor! Protect it at
              all costs!"
 xc2bat03 -  "We held... Remaining forces, report in!"
 xc2bat04 -  "The message got through, but we'll have to hold until they
              get here!"
 xc2bat05 -  "Enemy forces sighted! We will hold them back!"
 xc2bat06 -  "They are behind us! Direct all fire to the south!"
 xc2bat07 -  "GLA base in range! All teams ready to attack, General!"
 xc2bat08 -  "Enemy buildings on that ridge! Give the word, General, and
              we will roll over them!"
 xc2bat09 -  "Watch those RPG Troopers! We need help!"
 xc2bat10 -  "We are ready for your orders, General! Where do you need
              us?"
 xc2bat11 -  "Another wave! They're using suicide tactics! Where are
              those reinforcements??"


 Carpet Bomber:

 xc2boc01 -  "General, we are over the target area now, and have
              commenced bombing!"
 xc2boc02 -  "Rolling out the carpet... of bombs!"
 xc2boc03 -  "Enemy air defenses are thick here! We are taking heavy
              damage!"
 xc2boc04 -  "Stinger Sites have locked onto us! We are in trouble!"


 ECM Tank:

 xc2ecm01 -  "Another wave!! We need reinforcements!"
 xc2ecm02 -  "We've lost the Airfield!"
 xc2ecm03 -  "We're taking fire on the right flank! Support is needed
              here!"


 Red Guard:

 xc2re101 -  "We must be on our guard! Reports say the GLA might attack
              as revenge for our entering the war!"
 xc2re102 -  "I don't feel safe guarding this Nuclear Plant..."
 xc2re103 -  "Their food is much better! And they get to wear those
              fancy helmets!"
 xc2re104 -  "GLA forces!! We're under attack!"
 xc2re105 -  "The Command Center! They got the Command Center!"
 xc2re106 -  "Not much left! We're going to need reinforcements!"
 xc2re107 -  "Stop that Rebel, he's trying to capture our bunker!"
 xc2re108 -  "It isn't a Battlemaster, but it will have to do."
 xc2re109 -  "I prefer my Gattling Tank!"
 xc2re110 -  "Another GLA wave!"
 xc2re111 -  "We must protect our bunkers!"
 xc2re112 -  "We must protect the Nuclear Reactor!"
 xc2re113 -  "Now we will show them how to attack a base!"
 xc2re114 -  "Reinforcements! We are glad to see you!"
 xc2re115 -  "Another wave! They've got Bomb Trucks and Terrorists! We
              need reinforcements!"

 xc2re201 -  "Yeah, I wish I joined up with the air force instead..."
 xc2re202 -  "Surely after our recent victory they would not dare to
              attack us here!"
 xc2re203 -  "They are everywhere! We are being overrun!"


 Chinese EVA:

 xc2xoc01 -  "General, the GLA are attempting to steal the nuclear
              warheads stored at this facility!"
 xc2xoc02 -  "General, the GLA are attempting to destroy our main
              Nuclear Power Plant!"
 xc2xoc03 -  "Our brave soldiers held off their attack but at great cost
              and the GLA is still out there..."
 xc2xoc04 -  "You must hold off the GLA, and insure that every one of
              our Bunkers is protected!"
 xc2xoc05 -  "You must hold off the GLA to insure that the facility is
              not destroyed!"
 xc2xoc06 -  "We have several new technologies that should be of great
              benefit to your mission, General!"
 xc2xoc07 -  "Our Nuclear Cannons are now upgraded to fire Neutron
              Warheads. This new warhead effectively eliminate soldiers
              and vehicle drivers, once the radiation has cleared, one
              of our infantrymen can then capture the surviving
              vehicles."
 xc2xoc08 -  "Our buildings can now upgrade to EMP Mines. While still
              effective against infantry, they will also temporarily
              incapacitate enemy vehicles."
 xc2xoc09 -  "General, your reinforcements will arrive in 15 minutes!"
 xc2xoc10 -  "General, your reinforcements will arrive in 10 minutes!"
 xc2xoc11 -  "General, your reinforcements will arrive in 5 minutes!"
 xc2xoc12 -  "General, your reinforcements will arrive soon!"
 xc2xoc13 -  "General, our reinforcements have arrived!"
 xc2xoc14 -  "General, GLA forces are attacking the bunkers!"
 xc2xoc15 -  "General, GLA forces are attacking the Nuclear Plant!"
 xc2xoc16 -  "The GLA is attempting to capture one of our bunkers!"
 xc2xoc17 -  "General, this bunker is badly damaged! May I suggest it be
              repaired before another GLA attack?"
 xc2xoc18 -  "General, our Nuclear Plant is badly damaged! May I suggest
              it be repaired before another GLA attack?"
 xc2xoc19 -  "General, that last attack severely weakened several
              bunkers! If one of them is destroyed, the GLA will win
              this encounter!"
 xc2xoc20 -  "General, that last attack severely weakened the Nuclear
              Plant! If it is destroyed, we will fail our mission!"
 xc2xoc21 -  "WARNING: GLA forces moving towards the bunkers!"
 xc2xoc22 -  "WARNING: GLA forces are moving towards the Power Plant!"
 xc2xoc23 -  "General, I've made contact with one of our spy outposts,
              they are under GLA attack! If we can rescue them, I can
              patch into their system and we will be able to call in
              Carpet Bombers."
 xc2xoc24 -  "General, if you can secure that Spy Outpost, it will allow
              you to direct carpet bombing runs on the GLA forces!"
 xc2xoc25 -  "General, now that our reinforcements have arrived, it is
              time to eliminate the GLA from this area!"

              river. We must destroy it, but it will not be an easy
              task!"
 xc3xoc04 -  "Our operations have attracted much attention from the rest
              of the world, and we will be watched closely. The longer
              this battle goes on, the lower our International Opinion
              will fall..."
 xc3xoc05 -  "Damage to civilian property must be avoided. Our operation
              must be precise and swift! Destruction of GLA forces will

              increasing our International Opinion, and will boost
              support of our efforts amongst the population!"
 xc3xoc13 -  "They have dispatched a Toxic Tractor to clear our
              garrisonned structures!"
 xc3xoc14 -  "Our Dragon Tanks will be a high priority target! Guard
              them well!"
 xc3xoc15 -  "Well done, sir! The destruction of the Statue has caused
              World Opinion to rise!"
 xc3xoc16 -  "Do not let them destroy the buildings!"
 xc3xoc17 -  "Use the Neutron Shell to clear buildings without damaging
              them!"
 xc3xoc18 -  "Beware! Their defensive structures are hidden with Camo
              Netting!"
 xc3xoc19 -  "General, the GLA have the city well defended, we need to
              clear them out!"

              is now free of GLA control!"

 Chinese News Reporter:

 xc5nec01 -  "Millions cheer our soldiers in parades from Paris to Hong
              Kong. Surviving leaders of the crushed GLA will soon be
              tried by the world court. With America's power now
              reaching no further than its own shores, the world looks
              to China for strengh and prosperity. Tomorrow the
              Premiere will open the first meeting of Eurasian Unity
              League. It is for all of us and new day!"


 USA Officer:

 xc5ofu01 -  "Corporal, any sign of the Chinese yet?"
 xc5ofu02 -  "I hope they get here soon. Our intel points to a full
              scale GLA attack."
 xc5ofu03 -  "Our base has been breached! All units to your stations!
              Where are those Chinese we were promised?!"
 xc5ofu04 -  "They're capturing our buildings, we can't hold! All units,
              fall back! Repeat, fall back!!"

 Red Guard:

 xc5re101 -  "It feels like we are on an Easter Egg hunt, General!"


 Chinese EVA:

 xc5xoc01 -  "Thanks to your remarkable efforts in Halberstadt, the GLA
              are all but finished! US intel has located the last GLA
              stronghold outside of Hamburg. Unfortunately we were too
              late to help the Americans in this area, and the GLA
              captured their base... Build your forces and destroy both
              the GLA and US bases!"
 xc5xoc02 -  "The GLA have captured an old US Base in the region and are
              building up! Your final objective is to destroy both the
              US and GLA bases!"
 xc5xoc03 -  "The GLA have increased their stealth abilities, General!
              They can now stealth just about anything! We'll need to
              stay alert!"
 xc5xoc04 -  "Use your Listening Outposts to detect stealthed units!"
 xc5xoc05 -  "General, I suggest you first concentrate your attack on
              the US base! We need to take out their Particle Cannons!"
 xc5xoc06 -  "That's it! Power to the US base is down! Finish them
              quickly before they can rebuild!"
 xc5xoc07 -  "Well done, General! The enemy can no longer produce US
              units!"
 xc5xoc08 -  "Well done, General! The enemy can no longer produce GLA
              units!"
 xc5xoc09 -  "Well done, General! The US base has been neutralized!
              Destroy the GLA base to finish this battle!"
 xc5xoc10 -  "Well done, General! The GLA base has been neutralized!
              Destroy the US base to finish this battle!"
 xc5xoc11 -  "We must finish what the US was not able to do! The GLA
              must fall, and the world will be at peace..."
 xc5xoc12 -  "If we are able to defeat the GLA, and save Europe from its
              clutches, then there are great rewards to be had!"
 xc5xoc13 -  "General, you will take your place among China's finest
              heroes! The GLA has fallen, and China is the shining
              beacon in a new world! Take you place of honor and bask in
              the glory that is China!"
 xc5xoc14 -  "General, the enemy has improved their stealth ability, but
              they do not appear to be using tanks..."
 xc5xoc15 -  "General, the GLA commander is lacking tanks! Perhaps we
              can overwhelm him with our forces."
 xc5xoc16 -  "General, we are losing vehicles to Jarmen Kell! You must
              track him down if we are to stand a chance!"
 xc5xoc17 -  "General, the enemy is using Hijackers! We need to stop
              them!"
 xc5xoc18 -  "General, the enemy has positioned Snipers in the local
              villages! We must clear them out!"
 xc5xoc19 -  "General, we are losing troops to the enemy's Quad Cannons!
              We need heavy armor out here!"
 xc5xoc20 -  "General, current intel suggests Jarmen Kell may be holed
              up in this small village..."
 xc5xoc21 -  "General, the enemy's base seems to be on the other side of
              this river. Perhaps we can lock him in by positioning
              forces near the bridges."
 xc5xoc22 -  "General, we have many driverless vehicles in the field!
              Send units to recapture them!"
 xc5xoc23 -  "Sir, we have detected Battle Buses in Sector C! We should
              deal with them before they can reach our base!"
 xc5xoc24 -  "General, the enemy has slipped units into our base! We
              should improve our defenses!"
 xc5xoc25 -  "General, the enemy has infiltrated our base!"
 xc5xoc26 -  "General, taking out the American Command Center will put a
              stop to his heavy air support!"
 xc5xoc27 -  "General, we need to get our Internet Center built as
              quickly as possible! It will help us locate enemy
              positions!"
 xc5xoc28 -  "General, the enemy has left his flank unguarded! Now is
              our chance to counterattack!"
 xc5xoc29 -  "General, the Americans have superior stealth detection
              technology! Perhaps you should capture this base instead
              of destroying it."

              GLA can live on!"
 xg1xog03 -  "Dr. Thrax may have died for the cause, but that is
              inconsequential. If our brother escapes the US will not
              have seen the last of the GLA!"
 xg1xog04 -  "General, the Firebase defenses around this American
              position are too strong! We should avoid a direct
              confrontation and find another way into the base!"
 xg1xog05 -  "Hold you forces back, General! We are sending in a team to
              scout the other side of the bridge! They will report back
              on enemy positions."
 xg1xog06 -  "My General, one of our Quick Strike teams has managed to
              elude their American pursuers and have agreed to aid us in
              our mission! Their rocket pods should prove most useful
              against enemy armor."
 xg1xog07 -  "We have discovered one of our demolitions teams! They will
              help us to clear a path by destroying the outlying US
              support bases."
 xg1xog08 -  "General. We must secure the airfield before the transport
              plane arrives! The survival of the GLA depends on your
              success!"
 xg1xog09 -  "Sentry Drones! These Americans are most clever, their
              Drones are hidden when they are still! You must proceed
              with caution, General!"
 xg1xog10 -  "Our Combat Cycles are very versatile. They enhance the
              abilities of our loyal foot soldiers, and are able to
              travel over rough terrain. They are even able to survive a
              jump off cliffs. Use them to bypass American strong points
              and attack their vulnerable sides!"
 xg1xog11 -  "General, the Americans have sent a second group of
              pursuers to capture our leader! Protect him at all costs!"
 xg1xog12 -  "General, this hidden base can provide us with the
              resources we need to push past the American siege and
              reach the airfield!"
 xg1xog13 -  "General, our leader is under attack! He must not fall to
              the Americans!"
 xg1xog14 -  "General, your forces are moving too far ahead of our
              leader! Remember, that he must reach the airfield if our
              cause is to survive!"
 xg1xog15 -  "Another American base! It must be eliminated! Be wary of
              their Firebases, sir!"
 xg1xog16 -  "We are within reach of the airfield, General! Destroy the
              American forces and secure the area that we may fly our
              leader to safety!"
 xg1xog17 -  "Well done, General! With you in command, we can not fail!"
 xg1xog18 -  "We have reached the airfield, sir! Make sure our leader is
              ready and waiting at the airstrip when his plane arrives!"
 xg1xog19 -  "Our plane is on approach, General! Just hold your position
              a little longer! Our leader must survive to board that
              plane!"
 xg1xog20 -  "The plane has arrived! Load our leader in so that we may
              fly him to safety and regroup!"
 xg1xog21 -  "The plane is waiting for our leader to board. Make haste,
              and bring him in, General! Our forces cannot hold out
              indefinitely against the Americans!"
 xg1xog22 -  "Our operative, Jarmen Kell, has been harassing the
              American supply lines! He will be of great help to our

 xg1xog23 -  "Excellent work, General! We will show the Americans that
              we still have the power to resist them!"
 xg1xog24 -  "We have discovered an advance scout force, General! They
              have offered to aid us with our mission!"
 xg1xog25 -  "General! Take out the American power plants to shut down
              their base defenses!"

              battles more wisely!"

 xg2xog02 -  "Prince Kassad is beginning to take control wherever he
              can. We must put an end to his vie for power!"
 xg2xog03 -  "General, our resources are running low! We must find a new

 xg2xog06 -  "Beware! Kassad has launched a Sneak Attack against us!"
 xg2xog07 -  "We have much bigger plans than that rat Kassad! The world
              will quake as we unleash the fury of the GLA!"
 xg2xog08 -  "We have acquired GPS Scramble technology! Now we can use
              Kassad's tricks against him!"
 xg2xog09 -  "Excellent, General! We have secured the Sneak Attack
              ability!"
 xg2xog10 -  "Capture the enemy Command Centers!"
 xg2xog11 -  "If we can capture the enemy Command Center we can use
              their technology against them!"

              their knowledge to progress towards our goal of uniting
              the GLA under one flag!"
 xg2xog13 -  "We are running low on resources! We must capture some Oil
              Derricks!"
 xg2xog14 -  "Our enemy is attacking our oil supply! They must be
              stopped!"

              advanced tactics to defeat them!"

              abilities to turn the tide of this battle!"
 xg2xog27 -  "Prince Kassad is no more! The GLA are once again united
              against our enemies!"
 xg2xog28 -  "Now that we have the GPS Scramble, we can move unseen past

 xg2xog29 -  "The traitor has fortified himself on this hilltop and cut
              all other means of access! Sneak Attack is the only way we

 xg3xog05 -  "The USA has attacked our secret base in the

 xg3xog06 -  "But before it was wiped out, we learned of the location of

 xg3xog07 -  "Most of their ships are in port and helpless. We will
              steal their Particle Cannon and use it to take out their

 xg3xog12 -  "Our Rebels can use their Capture Building ability to take

 xg3xog18 -  "This Arms Dealer will serve us well!"
 xg3xog19 -  "We have reclaimed our Command Center!"
 xg3xog20 -  "General, do you see those enemy supply planes? If we could
              destroy their Drop Zones, we could cripple their
              production!"
 xg3xog21 -  "Ahh... this Toxin Tractor will come in handy!"
 xg3xog22 -  "These Quad Cannons will defend us from enemy aircraft!"
 xg3xog23 -  "These Marauders will boost our firepower!"
 xg3xog24 -  "Destroy these tanks and we can liberate the Barracks!"
 xg3xog25 -  "If we clear this area, we can safely occupy the Command
              Center!"

 xg3xog28 -  "Comanches! Rally our defenses!"
 xg3xog29 -  "We must defend against those Comanches!"
 xg3xog30 -  "They are trying to retake the Particle Cannon!"
 xg3xog31 -  "Their aircraft have destroyed our Tunnel Network!"
 xg3xog32 -  "Those clever villains... they are targeting our Power
              Plants! We need power to use the Particle Cannon!"
 xg3xog33 -  "Almost all of the Power Plants have been destroyed... We
              must have power to use the Particle Cannon!"
 xg3xog34 -  "If we could capture some power plants, we could use the
              Particle Cannon against them!"
 xg3xog35 -  "Ahh... We have found some hidden goodies!"
 xg3xog36 -  "This pass is well defended! We should use the Particle
              Cannon to blast through!"
 xg3xog37 -  "Be careful, this pass is heavily guarded!"
 xg3xog38 -  "They have dispatched infantry onto the islands!"
 xg3xog39 -  "Their choppers are bringing reinforcements!"
 xg3xog40 -  "They have launched an A-10 Strike against us!"
 xg3xog41 -  "They've paradropped onto the Particle Cannon!"
 xg3xog42 -  "We have disabled their Supply Drop Zones! Their production
              will be crippled!"
 xg3xog43 -  "Your mission is to destroy the enemy Aircraft Carrier with
              their own Particle Cannon. You will have to penetrate
              their base on the mainland to get a visual lock on the
              Carrier so that you can destroy it!"
 xg3xog44 -  "Good work! Now we must secure some Power Plants!"
 xg3xog45 -  "The Tunnel Network will bring us to the next island."
 xg3xog46 -  "The Particle Cannon is now online! We must defend it and
              the Power Plants!"
 xg3xog47 -  "All of our units and buildings have been destroyed!"
 xg3xog48 -  "Without the Particle Cannon, it will be impossible to sink
              the Carrier!"
 xg3xog49 -  "Now the Americans shall taste bitter defeat!"
 xg3xog50 -  "They destroyed our Tunnel Network! Use the Sneak Attack to
              reclaim the Particle Cannon!"
 xg3xog51 -  "We are closing in on the Aircraft Carrier! It is just
              south of here!"
 xg3xog52 -  "There is the Aircraft Carrier! Destroy it using the
              Particle Cannon!"
 xg3xog53 -  "Jarmen Kell is here to serve us!"
 xg3xog54 -  "His snipe ability can disable enemy vehicles, allowing our
              infantry to then capture them."
 xg3xog55 -  "These docked Battleships are harmless."
 xg3xog56 -  "The Battleship is bombarding us! Destroy it!"
 xg3xog57 -  "This must be the enemy's main base!"
 xg3xog58 -  "These Fake Buildings will fool our foes!"
 xg3xog59 -  "Build more Fake Structures to trick the enemy!"
 xg3xog60 -  "We will avenge this cowardly attack!"

 xg4jar03 -  "The remains of the American naval force have moved to the

 xg4jar04 -  "We defeated them there, and we shall be victorious here!"
 xg4jar05 -  "Brothers, rejoice! Once we have the toxins from this

              of MASS infection!"
 xg4jar06 -  "The Americans have meddled for too long! ...With this new

 xu3bla07 -  "I will draw the camp guards attention to this side of the

              couple guards, and I'll have everyone freed."

              defenses around the mountains are correct. General, we
              ought to rescue them too!"
 xu3bur10 -  "General, I'm in position near the second POW Camp! There's
              a Tunnel Network and guards out front! I could slip past
              them into the compound if I climbed down the cliffs on the
              south end of the camp!"

              your last mission."
 xu3xou03 -  "The GLA are working on a new Weapon of Mass Destruction.
              Black Lotus must download this data so we know how far
              along their research has come."
 xu3xou04 -  "Once she has completed her download, Colonel Burton must
              bring down the mountainside on the lab and bury it
              forever."
 xu3xou05 -  "General, your first objective is the destruction of this
              bridge! Its destruction will cut off GLA reinforcements
              from the other side of the river."
 xu3xou06 -  "General, GLA reinforcements have been sighted crossing the
              bridge!"
 xu3xou07 -  "Another GLA squad has entered the area, General! Perhaps
              we should take care of that bridge now."
 xu3xou08 -  "General, it appears that there are several GLA Radar Vans
              in the area! If your forces get to close, they will be
              detected."
 xu3xou09 -  "Excellent job, General! Now you only need to worry about
              GLA forces on this side of the river!"
 xu3xou10 -  "The GLA have a POW Camp along the route Colonel Burton
              must take to the GLA Lab. If you free the men held there,
              Colonel Burton will have an easier time getting to the
              Lab!"
 xu3xou11 -  "General, intel suggests you free the men at the POW Camp
              before you send Colonel Burton too far away!"
 xu3xou12 -  "Congratulations, General! I'm sure the families of those
              men will be happy to hear they've been rescued!"
 xu3xou13 -  "General, the GLA's Lab is directly north of your current
              position! There are a number of GLA defenses still along
              your route, be careful!"
 xu3xou14 -  "It appears that those Oil Derricks are the only source of
              income for the GLA base. If you can destroy them you will
              cripple the GLA here!"
 xu3xou15 -  "General, I'm patching through Black Lotus!"
 xu3xou16 -  "General, the men you just rescued are driving our newest
              vehicle, the Microwave Tank!"
 xu3xou17 -  "This vehicle has two modes... The first generates a
              continuous microwave field in front of the vehicle, very
              lethal to ALL infantry. The second allows it to disrupt
              the functions of any targeted building."
 xu3xou18 -  "General, the GLA know we are here and appear to be on
              heightened alert! Be careful when moving Colonel Burton
              into position above their Secret Lab!"
 xu3xou19 -  "General, the GLA have upgraded their tank shells to
              contain poisons, be careful!"
 xu3xou20 -  "I'm showing a GLA patrol in that village, General, as well
              as a number of enemy forces garrisoned throughout the
              village!"
 xu3xou21 -  "Maybe Black Lotus can find out more intel about who is
              behind the GLA WMD program."
 xu3xou22 -  "That was incredible, General! Looks like the GLA won't be
              using that facility anymore! And it seems Black Lotus
              downloaded some vital info about the source of this lab.
              For now, let's regroup and see what she was able to find
              out. Great work!"

              destroyed. The cause is served, the Global Liberation Army
              has once more been run to ground. Weapons of Mass
              Destruction, like those launched from Baikonur, no longer

 xu5xou02 -  "We've tracked Dr. Thrax to this remote location. He's in
              possession of chemical tipped missiles, and has them
              prepped for launch. Destroying his toxin storage tanks has
              slowed him down, but we must move in and secure those

 xu5xou04 -  "General, due to the civilian presence in this location,
              you will need to use ground forces to assault the final
              base and capture the 4 Toxin Missile Sites in the area!
              Our successful liberation of the oil sites in Amisbad has
              provided us with additional resources for this operation."
 xu5xou05 -  "Dr. Thrax must be defeated so he can't inflict further
              terror on the world! General, you must stop him!"
 xu5xou06 -  "Our intel indicates that THIS is the best area to build

 xu5xou07 -  "General, the local GLA have responded to your rescue and
              have given us control of their base! You may now use their

              Missile Silos targeted on US major metropolitan areas
              before they launch!"

              in this region! Use caution and make sure those toxins
              aren't released!"
 xu5xou26 -  "Infantry won't work well here, General! Our enemy is using
              toxins in almost every weapon that they throw at us!"
 xu5xou27 -  "General, your objective is to capture this structure, not
              destroy it! If those toxins are released then the region
              will be contaminated for 100 square miles!"
 xu5xou28 -  "General, our intel indicates that if we can leak the
              napalm in those tanks into those nearby tunnels exits we
              can flood their whole system!"
 xu5xou29 -  "Congratulations, General! Dr. Thrax won't be poisoning the

 xu5xou31 -  "We have a green light on Operation: Eagle's Strike! Launch
              the attack on Toxin Production Facilities!"
 xu5xou32 -  "General, your orders are to build a base to attack the

              capture the enemies 4 Toxin Missile Sites before they can
              launch!"

              against the Toxin General and his mass use of toxic
              weapons! (gasp) They wish to aid us in our attack against
              him by giving us use of their base!"
 xu5xou34 -  "General, the enemy has detected our presence in their main
              base and have begun launch preparations for the Toxin
              Missiles! The should have launch capability in
              approximately 30 minutes. Intel has located and revealed
              the 4 Missile Sites on your radar screen."
 xu5xou35 -  "General, intel places some of the missiles in this region!

 MD_China01_0.bik:

 "Good afternoon! As the America withdraws their troops to strenghten
  homeland defense, our own nation now takes the rightful path to lead
  the world against terrorism. In a televised address, our Premiere
  again denied involvement with GLA hoodlums and condemned their use of
  stolen Chinese armaments against our great ally. The Premiere's
  military commanders have pledged to repel the GLA from former American
  bases in Europe. China will not allow continue GLA control of advanced
  US military hardware. Our opinion polls show majority of citizens
  support the Premiere and ask for swift retribution. From our post in
  Germany, this is Sun Meiying, Beijing One News!"


 MD_China02_0.bik:

 "An overwhelming defeat at the hands of our brave troops has sent
  stunned GLA soldiers underground. In response to new threat by the
  remaining terrorist command, our homeland security has been tightened.
  The Premiere wishes to assure citizens that the GLA will not be
  permitted to infiltrate our nation as they did America. Reports from
  our cities confirm our people stand home and ready for any situation.
  Sun Meiying reporting from our Middle East News Desk!"


 MD_China03_0.bik:

 "In response to GLA still-desperate attempt to force a nuclear
  stalemate, the Premiere was called to the European Security Council's
  Defense Summit. With full support of the Council, China's armed forces
  have been honored with the task of driving GLA forces from Europe
  cities and re-establishing order. Meanwhile, the Premiere assured the
  United Nations that China regrets the unavoidable use of nuclear arms
  to break the latest GLA offensive and will use restraint in future
  confrontations. With our European Army Division, I'm Sun Meiying!"


 MD_China04_0.bik:

 "Our victorious forces continue their liberation of Europe's cities,
  sweeping the GLA from the streets. In today's Security Council session
  the Premiere humbly accepted the world's gratitude but cautioned that
  the GLA should be hunted down to the last soldier. 'This is a wounded
  animal' declared our leader, 'but it must not find a cave where it
  might gather back its strength'. The USA now chooses to concentrate on
  her own borders, but China is here to help our European comrades. Our
  new allies agree with the Premiere's strategy and our military has
  launched new aggressive campaigns against the terrorists. This is Sun
  Meiying reporting!"


 MD_China05_0.bik:

 "Statement of supports from Europe's capitals flow to Premiere's desk
  as scattered GLA units are destroyed by Chinese divisions. Our leader
  in turn praises his field commanders for low civilian casualties and
  collateral damage in war zones. The General of the Army reports one
  last GLA stronghold to be cleansed before peace is achieved. And with
  NATO now a political afterthought, China has proposed a newly formed
  alliance with Europe to share military and economic strategies. This
  is Sun Meiying at our Middle East Bureau!"

 ARC News - Omar Bin Ghazali

 MD_GLA01_0.bik:

 "Although the United States has ordered its mercenaries to hunt down
  Dr. Thrax, the Global Liberation Army has abandoned efforts to protect
  the rogue scientist who is known to be unstable. Senseless American
  aggression once more filled the skies with smoke and fire, but despite
  this air power and combined brute strength, China and America cannot
  hope to break the GLA chain of command. GLA leaders promised in
  continuing the war of attrition against the enemy of freedom. It is a
  war... they will win! This is Omar Bin Ghazali reporting!"


 MD_GLA02_0.bik:

 "The desolation here results from a ruthless campaign against a single
  man, Dr. Thrax, whom the GLA has discredited and denounced. America
  and China report several GLA leaders have been killed, resulting in a
  power vacuum with splinter groups vying for control. This is called
  wishful thinking. Our sources confirmed that the GLA is simply
  reorganizing to more effective defeat their enemies. From the field,
  I am Omar Bin Ghazali!"


 MD_GLA03_0.bik:

 "Lies persist in the corrupt Western media that the Global Liberation
  Army now has a fragmented leadership. More reliable reports from the
  GLA revealed the truth: A new powerful commander has emerged with the
  complete support of the people. Furthermore, US Intelligence chapter
  warns major action by the revitalized GLA is imminent. The American
  has strengthened defenses at their international bases. This is a
  laughable strategy against a strike that could come at any time at any
  place. From News Headquarter, I am Omar Bin Ghazali!"


 MD_GLA04_0.bik:

 "The destruction here is overwhelming. As America's Mediterranean fleet
  sinks and wallows in the sea, this crushing blow by the GLA has led to
  serious re-evaluation of US presence aboard, with rumors that America
  will end its war crimes and pull its forces from Europe altogether.
  That day will mark a GLA victory that many have waited before. Live
  from the Mediterranean, I am Omar Bin Ghazali!"


 MD_GLA05_0.bik:

 "As the world last so-called superpower crumbles the GLA grows
  stronger, humiliating America by penetrating its own borders and
  raiding its Weapons of Mass Destruction. Washington rumbles with the
  cries to abandon European bases and protect the homeland, and the GLA
  is determined to force this expulsion. The ranks of GLA swirl with
  countless victims of foreign aggression and splinter cells unite
  against our common enemy. This inspiring statement comes from the GLA
  Supreme Command: We are everywhere! No walls or boundaries will hold
  us back! No imperialist army will stand before us until all are free!"

 BNN - James Seabury

 MD_USA01_0.bik:

 "Although America's military has fragmented Global Liberation Army on
  the run following the last conflict here, terrorist activity remains
  clear and present danger. Heavily armed assailants continue their
  occupation of the Baikonur Launch Facility in Kazakhstan. The GLA has
  armed the missiles at Baikonur with newly designed chemical warheads.
  This arsenal is aimed toward Europe, and evacuations of urban centers
  have already begun. The previous attempt by the Chinese to retake the
  facility has failed. With Chinese troops battling local warlords to
  the East, the United States has been asked to undertake the Baikonur
  mission. Tensions are high. A failed counterstrike could significantly
  weaken the America's influence and strategic interest in Europe. From
  Falcon Base Command Center, I'm James Seabury!"


 MD_USA02_0.bik:

 "With the victory at Baikonur and the elimination of the GLA missiles
  threat under their belts, American forces faced the task of rebuilding
  the landscapes ravaged by war. Aboard these ships are tons of foods
  and medical supplies en route to a desperate population. Although
  relief convoys have been harassed by warlords linked to the GLA, US no
  longer considers the terrorist organization a serious threat.
  Nonetheless, a Navy Aircraft Carrier is in the region to lend air
  support. Meanwhile, Special Forces continue their search for GLA
  caches rumored to include Weapons of Mass Destruction."


 MD_USA03_0.bik:

 "A terrorist base destroyed by the American forces while defending
  civilian relief convoys has yielded documents that provide important
  clues regarding the GLA toxin program. Reports suggest that a key
  research facility as well as possible source of funding for the lethal
  program have been identified. Although the US Commander will not
  provide confirmation, our network analysts predict that if the
  intelligence is reliable, America will respond. This is James Seabury
  reporting from Falcon Base!"


 MD_USA04_0.bik:

 "Following the assault and catch of a secret GLA Lab, no doubt remains
  the terrorists are engaged in toxin production. The United States
  believes that a General, codenamed Dr. Thrax, is running the lethal
  program. Little is known about this elusive extremist who also been
  charged with war crimes by the World Court. We understand there is
  intense pressure on American Intelligence Agencies to trace the
  funding for Dr. Thrax's research. Only by choking up the cash supplied
  by covert oil supplies, can the US hope to cripple the threat of a
  terrorist army hording Weapons of Mass Destruction?"

 "Somewhere in this besieged city, the man known as Dr. Thrax
  orchestrates his last stand against America. The recent capture of the
  GLA oil field has cut off the pipeline funding Dr. Thrax and his
  weapon research. Now, with his enemies closing in, the chemical
  welding warlord threatens to unleash missiles loaded with Gamma Toxin,
  among the most deadly nerve agents ever developed. Hoping to avoid an
  incident even more catasthropic than the Baikonur disaster, the
  American respond is its signature Shock & Awe campaign. Eliminating
  Dr. Thrax will surely decimate the GLA offensive capabilities.

  Seabury reporting from the field!"
