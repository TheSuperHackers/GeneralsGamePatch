How to use:

* Play in singleplayer with vGLA computer enemy

* In the map select one of the workers in the top left corner and press "s" to do things. You can spam click "s" to spawn fast. You can even select multiple workers simultaneously.

* You can spawn 1, 10 or 100 of each of the three types. Stuff labeled accordingly.

* One more worker to transfer these units to human player, if desired

* One more worker to clear all spawned units

* Current amount of spawned in units is displayed in bottom right corner. Destroyed units are not subtracted. Use "Remove" to reset.

All units are spawned (stacked) on top of each other but that doesn't make a difference for the crash
