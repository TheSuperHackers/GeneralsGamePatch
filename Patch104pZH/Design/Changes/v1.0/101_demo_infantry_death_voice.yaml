title: Fixes wrong death sounds of GLA Demo infantry units

changes:
  - fix: The Demo General's Infantry units will no longer play the blown-up Terrorist sound effect when killed with an explosive. This will prevent confusion among players, as the sound effect is typically associated with the Suicide/Demolitions ability.
