title: Decreases sight range of USA Colonel Burton from 500 to 400

changes:
  - tweak: The shroud clearing range of USA Colonel Burton is decreased by 20%, from 500 to 400. This matches the shroud clearing range of the other Hero units. With the SEARCH AND DESTROY Battle Plan, Colonel Burton will now have a shroud clearing range of 480 instead of originally 600.
