title: Removes gun deployment mechanic from USA Sentry Drone

changes:
  - tweak: Removes the gun deployment mechanic from USA Sentry Drone. It no longer requires 1 second to acquire a fresh target, and 2 seconds to engage a consecutive target if it needs to move to a new position. This is a time and performance boost. It will also make the unit feel more responsive in combat situations.
