title: Adds idle auto reload after 2100 ms to USA Patriot Battery

changes:
  - tweak: All weapons of the USA Patriot Battery will now reload when idle. This makes the base defense a bit better in scenarios where it managed to only fire a few of its rockets on its target and at least 2 seconds pass until the next attack.
