title: Increases China Gattling Tank spin timeout against ground units from 1000 to 2000 ms

changes:
  - tweak: The China Gattling Tank spin timeout against ground units is increased by 100%, from 1000 to 2000 ms. The spin timeout against air units is unchanged. This matches the spin timeout setup from Generals (CCG). With this change the Gattling Tank gun can be microed more generously against ground units to squeeze out the most damage potential.
