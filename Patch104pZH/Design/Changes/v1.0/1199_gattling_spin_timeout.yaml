title: Increases China Gattling Tank spin timeout from 1000 to 2000 ms

changes:
  - tweak: Increases GattlingTankGun ContinuousFireCoast from 1000 to 2000 ms. This matches the setup from Generals (CCG) and also the setting from the Zero Hour (ZH) GattlingTankGunAir. With this change the Gattling Tank gun can be microed more generously to squeeze out the most damage potential.
