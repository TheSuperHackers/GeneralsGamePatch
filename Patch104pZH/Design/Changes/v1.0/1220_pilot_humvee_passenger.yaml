title: Fixes USA Pilot not promoting the Humvee, but taking passenger seat instead

changes:
  - tweak: The USA Pilot is no longer able to accidentally take a passenger seat in a Humvee. Instead it now consistently promotes the Humvee when entered. A Vet 3 Humvee can no longer transport Pilots, but the Ambulance still can.
