title: Fixes USA Pilot not promoting the Humvee, but taking passenger seat instead

changes:
  - tweak: Forbids NO_GARRISON flag objects from entering Humvee. NO_GARRISON is unique to Pilot and makes it unable to enter civilian buildings, Tunnels and Bunkers. Cursor still appears and it promotes the Humvee when entered. Therefore a Vet 3 Humvee can no longer transport Pilots.
