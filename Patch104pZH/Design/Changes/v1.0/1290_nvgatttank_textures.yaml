title: Fixes and improves nvgatttank textures for China Gattling Tank

changes:
  - fix: Fixes nvgatttank textures. The chassis wheels have been replaced with proper headlamps in the same style as Outpost and Nuke Cannon. The headlamp piece is mapped to both front and back. The Gattling barrels now look shiny by borrowing the same texture from other Gattling Cannons.
