title: Changes crane of China War Factory to animate on vehicle repair instead of vehicle construction

changes:
  - tweak: The repair pad crane of the China War Factory no longer moves while constructing a unit. Instead it now moves while repairing a unit. It is still possible to tell if a unit is being built, because the factory produces smoke from the chimney during construction.
