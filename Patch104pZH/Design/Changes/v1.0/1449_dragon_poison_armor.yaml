title: Increases poison damage resistance of China Dragon Tank by 20%

changes:
  - tweak: The poison damage armor of the China Dragon Tank is increased by 20%. Originally Dragon Tanks take 25% damage from POISON. Reducing this to 20% is a subtle and effective way to take some of the edge off of Toxin Tunnel Networks for all China factions.
