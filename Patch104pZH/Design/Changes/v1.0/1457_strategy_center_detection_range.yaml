title: Decreases SEARCH AND DESTROY stealth detection range of USA Strategy Center from 500 to 300

changes:
  - tweak: Decreases SEARCH AND DESTROY stealth detection range of USA Strategy Center from 500 to 300. As all heroes (now) have a sight range of 400, options for reacting to a Strategy Center's presence before being detected are incredibly limited. Not only this, but the structure's extensive stealth detection range over the owner's entire base effectively renders heroes useless - on top of the substantial range bonus that Search and Destroy provides. Reducing the stealth detection range is a reasonable way to counterbalance the incredible effectiveness of S&D without directly affecting the bonus itself.
