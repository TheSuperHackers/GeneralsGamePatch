title: Decreases SEARCH AND DESTROY vision range bonus for USA Strategy Center from 800 to 600

changes:
  - tweak: Decreases the SEARCH AND DESTROY vision range bonus for USA Strategy Center from 800 to 600. Accordingly, the Strategy Center no longer has an extreme shroud-clearing range of 800 under the effects of Search and Destroy. It was an unnecessary advantage for USA that discounts map awareness. The range has been reduced to a more palatable range of 600 - a 1.5x increase of the default vision range of 400. This was preferred over reducing the default vision of 400 to 300 due to the Bombardment cannon's weapon range of 400.
