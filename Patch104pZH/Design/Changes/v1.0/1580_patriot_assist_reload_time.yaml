title: Increases reload time of USA Patriot missile assist weapons from 1000 to 2000

changes:
  - fix: Increases the reload time of USA Patriot missile assist weapons from 1000 to 2000. This way reload time is consistent for all weapons of the Patriot Battery and there can be no scenarios where the turret can shoot on new targets after just 1 instead of 2 seconds.
