title: Adds idle auto reload after 2100 ms for China Overlord, Emperor

changes:
  - fix: The China Overlord will now always reload when idle. This makes the unit a bit better in scenarios where it managed to only fire with one of its barrel on its target and some time passes until the next target is attacked.
