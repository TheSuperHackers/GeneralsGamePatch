title: Adds idle auto reload after 2100 ms to China Overlord, Emperor

changes:
  - tweak: The China Overlord will now always reload when idle. This makes the unit a bit better in scenarios where it managed to only fire with one of its barrels on its target and at least 2 seconds pass until the next attack.
