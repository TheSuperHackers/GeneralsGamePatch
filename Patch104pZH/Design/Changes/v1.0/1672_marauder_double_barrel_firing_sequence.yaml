title: Fixes issue where GLA Marauder with double gun scrap starts its firing sequence with a single shot only

changes:
  - fix: Sets correct firing sequence on GLA Marauder with double barrel. It will now always start by firing 2 clips instead of just 1 clip. This gives the unit an inconsequential buff.
