title: Adds idle auto reload after 850 ms to GLA Marauder with double gun salvage upgrade

changes:
  - tweak: The GLA Marauder will now always reload when idle. This makes the unit a bit better in scenarios where it managed to only fire with one of its barrels on its target and at least 850 ms pass until the next attack.
