title: Decreases kill experience reward of China Supply Truck from 50 to 25

changes:
  - tweak: Destroying a China Supply Truck now rewards 25 instead of 50 experience points (XP). This takes a bit of pressure off of China when losing Supply Trucks to the opposition by not promoting enemy units as much.
