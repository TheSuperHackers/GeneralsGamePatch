title: Adds idle auto reload after 15100 ms for GLA Scorpion with double rocket salvage upgrade

changes:
  - feature: The GLA Scorpion Rocket will now always reload when idle. This makes the unit a bit better in scenarios where it managed to only fire with one of its rockets on its target and some time passes until the next target is attacked.
