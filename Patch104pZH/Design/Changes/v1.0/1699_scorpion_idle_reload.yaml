title: Adds idle auto reload after 15100 ms to GLA Scorpion with double rocket salvage upgrade

changes:
  - tweak: The GLA Scorpion Rocket will now always reload when idle. This makes the unit a bit better in scenarios where it managed to only fire with one of its rockets on its target and at least 15 seconds pass until the next attack.
