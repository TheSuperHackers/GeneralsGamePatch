title: Adds idle auto reload after 2100 ms to China Tank Battlemaster with Autoloader upgrade

changes:
  - tweak: The China Tank Battlemaster with Autoloader upgrade will now always reload when idle. This makes the unit much better in scenarios where it managed to only fire 1 or 2 of its shells and at least 2 seconds pass until the next attack.
