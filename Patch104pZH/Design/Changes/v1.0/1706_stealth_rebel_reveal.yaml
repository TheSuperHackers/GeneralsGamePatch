title: Fixes GLA Stealth Rebels becoming revealed when taking damage

changes:
  - fix: The GLA Stealth Rebels no longer become revealed when taking damage. Originally the Stealth Rebel variant is the only Rebel to reveal itself when receiving damage. Moreover, no other stealth-capable unit in the game exhibits this behaviour.
