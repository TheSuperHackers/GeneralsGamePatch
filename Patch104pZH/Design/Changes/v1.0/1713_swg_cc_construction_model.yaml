title: Fixes issue where wrong USA Super Weapon Command Center model is shown during construction and deconstruction

changes:
  - fix: Super Weapon General now uses the correct Command Center model during construction and deconstruction states. This is only noticeable when construction nears 100% or for the first ~44 frames when sold (the faction logo is now visible during these times).
