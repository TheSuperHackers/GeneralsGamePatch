title: Fixes issue where wreck of GLA Bomb Truck can spawn after its death explosion

changes:
  - fix: There is a random 200 ms destruction delay on death of GLA Bomb Truck. This means that the hulk and effects spawns a bit later than the death explosion. With this fix the wreck of the GLA Bomb Truck will always spawn right on death.
