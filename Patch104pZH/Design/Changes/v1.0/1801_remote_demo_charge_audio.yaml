title: Reduces audio range and volume of Remote Demo Charge

changes:
  - tweak: Reduces the Remote Demo Charge's maximum audio range from 800 to 250, minimum audio range from 175 to 100. This makes the presence of a demo charge much less obvious as it has its audible area reduced by 90%.
  - tweak: Reduces the Remote Demo Charge's maximum volume from 65 to 40, minimum volume from 40 to 20. This makes the bomb beep sound much quieter.
