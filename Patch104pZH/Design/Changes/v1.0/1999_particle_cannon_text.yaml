title: Shortens English Particle Cannon timer text

changes:
  - tweak: The English Superweapon timer text "Particle Uplink Cannon" now reads "Particle Cannon". This naming is consistent with every other mention of the Particle Cannon in English localization and also takes less precious space on the game screen.
