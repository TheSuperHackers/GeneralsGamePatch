title: Decreases secondary damage of Anthrax Beta Scud Storm missiles from 200 to 175

changes:
  - tweak: The secondary damage of the Anthrax Beta Scud Storm missiles is decreased from 200 to 175. This way it can no longer take out as many structures in a large area, but is still stronger than the regular Scud Storm.
