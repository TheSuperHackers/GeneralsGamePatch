title: Decreases primary damage of Anthrax Gamma Scud Storm missiles from 550 to 500

changes:
  - tweak: The primary damage of the Anthrax Gamma Scud Storm missiles is decreased from 550 to 500. This way it can no longer take out pristine Superweapons in a single strike, but is still better than the Anthrax Beta Scud Storm.
