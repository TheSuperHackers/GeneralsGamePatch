title: Prioritizes larger Toxin and Radiation fields over smaller ones

changes:
  - tweak: Prioritizes larger Toxin and Radiation fields over smaller ones by assigning different amounts of hazard cleanup health and damage to different hazard field sizes. The huge fields of the Anthrax Bomb and Nuke Missile are 2 times stronger than large fields. Large fields of Scud Storm missiles are 5 times stronger than medium fields. And medium fields of Scud Launcher, Toxin Truck, Bomb Truck and Nuclear Reactor are 10 times stronger than small fields. With this progression it is no longer possible to cleanup large hazard fields with just one small hazard field put on top. Overall many hazard cleanups will take more effort and time than originally, unless the created hazard field is equal or larger than the overlapped hazard field.
