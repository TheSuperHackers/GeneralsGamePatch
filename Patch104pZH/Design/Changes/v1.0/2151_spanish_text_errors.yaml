title: Fixes errors in Spanish strings

  - fix: The wording in Spanish tool tip strings is more consistent now.
  - fix: The TOOLTIP:NumberOfVotes string now has Spanish text.
  - fix: The Spanish tool tip for the GLA Terrorist now describes the unit as "Soldado suicida" and is therefore more consistent with the English wording.
  - fix: Some rare Spanish speech subtitles no longer print the first row in bold font.
