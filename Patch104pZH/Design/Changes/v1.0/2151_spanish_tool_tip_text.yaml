title: Fixes errors in Spanish tool tip strings

changes:
  - fix: The wording in Spanish tool tip strings is more consistent now.
  - fix: The TOOLTIP:NumberOfVotes string now has Spanish text.
  - fix: The Spanish tool tip for the GLA Terrorist now describes the unit as "Soldado suicida" and is therefore more consistent with the English wording.
