title: Improves death effects of GLA Radar Van and Quad Cannon

changes:
  - fix: The final destructions of the GLA Radar Van and Quad Cannon now have a suitable delay to better accomodate the immediate explosion effect with the Demo Upgrade.
  - fix: The GLA Radar Van and Quad Cannon now have an initial death effect and sound to better show their exact moment of death.
