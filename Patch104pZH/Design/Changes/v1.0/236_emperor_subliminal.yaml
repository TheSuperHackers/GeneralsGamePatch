title: Adds missing Subliminal Messaging bonus to China Emperor

changes:
  - fix: The China Emperor Tank now benefits from Subliminal Messaging, meaning the healing rate can be upgraded from 1% per second to 2% per second. With Subliminal Messaging, the unit will grant the SUBLIMINAL status to nearby units, which means an additional +25% Rate of Fire.
