title: Adds missing red smoke effect for GLA Demo Terrorist on Combat Bike after Demo Upgrade

changes:
  - fix: The Demo General's Terrorist now uses the correct red explosion effects when destroyed or suicided while riding a Bike after being upgraded with Demolitions, instead of the explosion effects of a normal Terrorist.
