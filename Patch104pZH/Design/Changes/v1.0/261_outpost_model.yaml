title: Fixes model issues of China Listening Outpost

changes:
  - fix: The China Listening Outpost will no longer show its damage smoke particles after being fully repaired. It therefore will no longer reveal itself to the opposition with the smoke column seemingly coming out of nowhere.
  - fix: The headlights of the The China Listening Outpost are now visible from all angles.
