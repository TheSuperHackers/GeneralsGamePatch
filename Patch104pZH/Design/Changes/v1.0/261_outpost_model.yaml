title: Fixes China Listening Outpost

changes:
  - fix: After being fully repaired, the China Listening Outpost will no longer show its damage smoke particles. It therefore will no longer reveal itself to the opposition with the smoke column seemingly coming out of nowhere.
  - fix: Headlight now visible from all angles.
  - tweak: Headlight now turns off when stationary.
