title: Fixes GLA Fake Command Center looking different to real Command Center after Fortified Structure upgrade

changes:
  - fix: When upgraded with Fortified Structures, the Fake GLA Command Centers of the Stealth, Tox and Demo General will no longer lose their sub-faction decal. They will have the correct appearance with the decal even with the upgrade.
