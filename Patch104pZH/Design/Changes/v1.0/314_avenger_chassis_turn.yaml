title: Fixes USA Avenger turning its chassis when aiming at air units

changes:
  - fix: The USA Avenger no longer turns its chassis to the targeted air unit. Only the anti-air laser turret will aim towards the air unit, while the USA Avenger either stays as is or aims with the blue laser marker at ground targets.
