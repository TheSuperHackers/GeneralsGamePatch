title: Adds missing Stop button to GLA Tunnel and GLA Palace

changes:
  - fix: The Palace now has a Stop button, which can be used to make passengers stop firing.
  - fix: The Demo General's Tunnel Network now has a Stop button, like other Tunnels.
  - fix: The Stop buttons of the non-Demo General Tunnels are placed similarly to other Base Defenses and have a dedicated button for Rallypoint. Other Base Defenses like the Fire Base and Bunker also have a dedicated button for Stop. The Rallypoint button is no longer superfluous and can be used to set a Rallypoint.
