title: Adds ability to GLA Stealth Saboteur to enter China Internet Center and GLA Fake Buildings

changes:
  - fix: The GLA Stealth Saboteur can now enter the China Internet Center. This will disable the structure for 15 seconds. This is consistent with the behaviour of the regular GLA Saboteur.
  - fix: The GLA Stealth Saboteur can now enter GLA Fake Buildings. This will destroy the Fake Building. This is consistent with the behaviour of the regular GLA Saboteur.
