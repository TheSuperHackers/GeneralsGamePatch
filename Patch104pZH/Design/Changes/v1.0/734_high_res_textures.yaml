title: Recoveres 483 high quality textures from Generals

changes:
  - fix: Recoveres 483 high quality textures from Generals. In Zero Hour they were downscaled, either by mistake or as a way to reduce the video memory requirements. The textures are related to civilian and faction buildings for the most part.
