title: Decreases kill experience reward of China Hackers

changes:
  - tweak: Killing a China Hacker now rewards 50 100 150 400 instead of 50 60 80 100 experience points (XP). This is a significant reduction. The new values have been choosen because the USA Drop Zone, worth 4 Hackers, gives 200 XP flat. And a Vet 3 Hacker makes twice as much money as he started with, so a doubling of XP is reasonable. Killing 4 Vet 3 Hackers would give 400 XP, twice as much as a Drop Zone and Black Market.
