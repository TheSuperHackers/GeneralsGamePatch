title: Decreases pack and unpack times of China Hackers

changes:
  - tweak: All China Hackers now unpack and pack their laptops quicker. The packing time variation is decreased significantly from 100% to 20%. This adds more time consistency when packing and unpacking. The unpack base time is just marginally tweaked to accommodate the pack variation for improved animation optics. The pack time is decreased to 75%, allowing Hackers to flee the scene a bit quicker.
