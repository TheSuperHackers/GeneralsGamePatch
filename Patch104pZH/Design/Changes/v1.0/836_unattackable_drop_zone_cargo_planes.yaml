title: Makes USA Supply Drop Zone Cargo Planes not automatically attacked

changes:
  - tweak: |
      The USA Supply Drop Zone Cargo Planes are no longer attacked automatically. This
        - gets rid of attack notification spams on Radar and Voice
        - improves performance in spam and AOD matches where many planes no longer draw fire
        - removes the auto attack from Mig, Raptor in guard modes
        - preserves the Cargo Plane flight route so enemy player knows where it comes from
        - removes this free and passive cannon fodder unit for the USA Faction
      They can still be attacked by left-clicking on them with anti-air units selected.
