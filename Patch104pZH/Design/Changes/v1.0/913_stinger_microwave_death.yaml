title: Fixes GLA Stinger Troopers not dying individually by USA Microwave Tank damage

changes:
  - fix: GLA Stinger Troopers are now damaged individually by the Microwave. This way they no longer die all at once after a longer duration.
  - fix: Removes an odd Microwave hit effect on the Stinger Site.
