        <h1>C&C Generals Zero Hour Community Patch Questionnaire 1B</h1>
        <p>Total Responses: 407</p>
        <p>Here you can write anything that is on your mind related to this questionnaire. What do you find frustrating? What would you like to see improved?</p><table class="styled-table"><thead><tr><th>No</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I find it frustrating that Joker tagged me everywhere with this survey. Already answering it, now stop tagging me.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Do NOT appease noobs who just want new OP units and shit just because they want to see GLA do explosions. NO NEW UNITS / FACTIONS / ETC. Just fix what's already there like 1.06 did. We have mods for the rest. Otherwise, if you can do ANY DLL magic to fix even more memory leakage, it goes without saying that I'd love to see that even more.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Anything that will make the game easier to run without having to worry about crashes, desyncs. Also It would be cool if we'd be able to have more control over multiplayer games such as all players having unlimited money, start game with all generals powers unlocked, unlimited power, etc. Just for fun.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I hope changes will not make a different in the game play. </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I would love to see a new patch and hopefully fix some of the problems </td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>How much do I get paid now to fill this form in!!</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Fix terrorist freezing bug</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Combat Chinook, PDL Power on Airforce Units.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Would upgrade my (old) gentool for a new patch.  Haven't upgraded since the old version still supplies IP in the replay/display.  I don't care about seeing the IP just a unique (or sufficiently unique) string/hash to identify griefers re-joining lobbies (ideally this would be displayed in an easier place than the gentool menu).  Currently a large portion of the ip is set to 0 which can cause me to avoid playing with people I otherwise might.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Game Mis-match during online play needs to be fixed</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>i think the most important thing to grow zero hour would be one stable platform where you can play it with a decent ladder, no connection issues etc, but i know that´s not the aim of this patch. i still like the idea of the patch though, thank you guys for putting in the work </td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>An upgrade to -bit  Mac-Users</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Network connectivity, random crashes, lag</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>I'm well aware of the community split argument. I do not believe forcing everyone to update via gentool is the right way. If there needs to be a patch the pros are not the only ones concerned. There is a community minus the pros who play the game casually and have for years. 

Just to help pros out for a patch is bs. There needs to be a balance. No casual player ever complains about bugs that exist. They have learnt to live with them. It's the pros that complain this is wrong no this no this. 

The game has been perfectly fine for long minus a few small things but that does not give anyone any right to change it and impose a path on anyone that wants to play online.bwhat about the mods that are based on 1.04. All those would need to be redone. 

I'm sorry, I understand where you are coming from but you have no right perse to change a game to benefit a few. You can see from the manner in which questions have been asked in this survey about how you want to earn sympathy from the community because so many things are wrong supposedly. 
No they aren't. Just tell them in the face to you want to change the gameplay and buff or nerf factions. Again you have no right to this change.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>The most frustrating error in multiplayer ist the sync error. Fix this and i will donate 20€ to you</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Please fix zh and remove the iP from the menu completely. Thank you for the hard work.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Sudden errors in the middle of the fight</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Frustrating is the imbalance itself. China needs several boots.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Low fps and lags</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Is it possible to add a pro rules option (as there is today with the limit 1 sw)? </td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Basically, the game is well balanced except for the tank general. Although the tanks are cheaper and very strong here, the hackers, soldiers and planes are priceless. even if only a handful of hackers are lost, that is a huge loss compared to other chinese armies. The tank general also has no long-range weapons, such as infernos, atomic cannons or Thomahawks, so is actually always at a disadvantage, because on the one hand (as mentioned above) the aircraft are priceless and made of paper, the tanks are slow and he can actually counter nothing with the long-range weapons, therefore the tank general is easy prey for the enemy if he is only spamming long-range weapons.

Another concern would be that the community would break up, that some would have the patch and some would not, some (even) fewer games would be offered again if there were a unified patch (no MOD!) It would not be a problem for everyone. If there is a uniform patch, the game design (toolbar; command bar, where houses, units, etc. can be built - like Domi, Legis-Design) should not be changed.

Another (personal concern): In Germany there is only the censored version (change of voice, some dialogues so that sentences are left out, the soldiers don't suffer when they fall) They are obviously there, but not included, maybe you could reactivate them...?

</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>I'd like to see bugs fixed and some matchups balanced</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>This game still live for now only becuse it did not change if you change it you will killl it</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>I think the most unbalanced 1v1 matchup is air vs any USA. Something should be do e to fix it.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>We wanna ultra hd quality with ultra sound </td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>I am not that competitive so balance wise i dont really want to speak out, sometimes i still get some crashes or mismatches with people online which i would love to see fixed. but overall this game is already so much better than it used to be so thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>The game does not need global changes.  But only in the distribution, the creation of leagues similar to football, with a global rating of players in the public domain, where each player will have an officially confirmed level of skills and statistics.  This will contribute to the desire of new players to build up their skills.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>if you're gonna improve the things like say for example graphics or sound. dont make it too futury, i think people like the fact that its a bit older looking. and pls dont split up the community. and i find it good that there's finally gonna be looked at to make cnc even better</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>gg</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>I find it frustrating that these "expert" complaining aboit it will split the community because that is exactly what they are doing. By endorsing gameranger and not promoting revora and making it better.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>actually i think its just a tiny heacs up  if you beautifull peeps get that patch done im a bit concerned about 3 things: how will it impact mods can we still mod patched games or will we have to adjust mods and updates for it? 
will genpatcher still work with the patch? or will it be not needed anymore? its just that genpatcher made our work from tech support a bit more  easy and i heard that there is a new one in the works but how will the patch affect it and how will it affect the general state of the game in terms of tech support? 
thas for me personally the importanst one tbh how is it with cracks or irated copys will the patch work for them and maybe also render them playable online or wil it be able to detect some of them? since if we would publish a patch that supports cracks then EA might get a bit spicy i think    anyways those were all my kinda concerns i had  one last thing the survey does not seem to get that much positive response from what i heard some peeps think that some of the question are just straight up dumb  you may or may not want to take a look into that and see what the majority of the persons say maybe just add a scale from 1 to 10 on how good this survey was </td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Give SWG crusaders,let jarmen take 2 path hits, less CD on SW's</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>i want DC bug to be removed</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>The most frustrating thing i find is the Sheer lack of support for origin and the inability for people to apperntly seemingly understand NOT EVERYONE OWNS A PHYSICAL COPY NOW</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>The only improvement I would like to see is bug fixing for example not being able to move the units when there are to many on the map and/or serious error - data not synchronized.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>The lag of single player in zero hour has always been an issue, but I think EA never imagined the kind of mods there are now, ie ROTR and PFB which are obviously massive and eat the ram and memory as the original game was never built for such epics. However, as I never play online, I think the cheat system / exploits should be allowed to stay for sole single players who like to skirmish against the AI. For me in particular its nice to see what all the factions have to offer in an instant, by using exploits and cheats so you get a feel for which side you really like, then to play against the AI without cheats, but they are there if you must. </td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>anything that fix the bugs/problems/lag issues would be nice . thanks .</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Make quickmatch great again.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>Game is some times laggy and one issue with Russian tanks is they jumble up specially sentenial tank and their movement are very messy they start moving up in reverse </td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>An in-game menu when hosting a game that pops up when clicking a button to set all the rules in detail that host can change and players can see, rules like no rush, no auroras nuke migs demo upgrade etc. Would be nice but that's just my idea how to enforce rules which a lot of players really care about</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>Al commands lags are the worst and the most killing issue. If a patch can be done to fix it while being compatible with all other mods, this will be my lucky day</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>Crashes, Graphics Error, and Lagging</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>Potential that the game could've had if naval warfare was implemented on large maps.
The physics of units interacting with one another (no clipping through each other, turning at an unrealistic degree, 50 troops coming out of a tunnel at once, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>NERV HUMVEES PLS</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>Terror Bike rushes</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>I would like the overall visuals to be improved above anything else.</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>Lack of resolution options in game and having to resort to other means. Lack of proper support for windows Vista and above</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>A balance to the path finder, (reduce fire rate). A buff to GLA base defenses.  </td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>balance teams . like make AF weaker etc...</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>remove aurora and demo bikes</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>A custom launcher for Generals Zero Hour like the mods that Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun mods have would be nice; if not possible, having more freedom to edit the main menus more to provide more creativity to each mod would also be nice.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>Perfect Mod Go with it, a total stranger that have nothing to do with the creation of this survey :P</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>Biggest issue is the mismatch error in multiplayer games.</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>Perhaps a way for GLA and China armies to clear up toxins/radiation without having to use the non-stacking exploit would be a good implementation imho. Making some existing units/structures more useful would also be great, as well as making the most commonly used ones be less overpowered but not too much (such as missile defender humvees, technicals with terrorists, quad cannons against structures/vehicles somewhat, airforce general's king raptors and stealth commanches, laser general's laser turrets (and the range bug that exists currently), superweapon general's aurora alphas, infantry's attack outposts, nuke's battlemasters etc.) And last but not least, all the annoying range bugs and exploits like the propaganda bonus exploit and so on would be nice to get rid of, please!</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>I think a toggle would be perfect for this, it helps us mostly PvE players who are always looking forward to new updates, features, and balancing changes to the game. Multi-player players can have the option to choose between the two as it isn't forced upon them</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>I think spliting the players will be good becouse of the all players with gentool will be on one side and the others will be on the other side. Infact the other players are noobs or players who play the game one time per week. Please my laptob is 3 GB RAM and i want to play the new game on the same laptob.
</td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td>The first thing that absolutely needs to be fixed is the performance. This is something that mod can't fix, some of the times games can lag a lot due to various reasons (mostly AI things). If the game could take advantage of the power of modern hardware, hope it can reduce the lag, and maybe open a ton of possibility for modding and mapping. This is one of thing require official input since it required to modify game code.

The second is that the game needs proper widescreen support. By default, the game didn't support 1920x1080. You are either required to modify ini file or install gentool, it would be great if the game has that option available by default

The third would involve some balance problem, might change gameplay, and upset some players. I felt like each general is not unique enough, for example, Laser General didn't have that many laser units, adding Laser Comanche would be the first step. Stealth is one thing that needs some changes, either reduce the stealth detection range or remove stealth detection from all defensive structures and units like USA Pathfinder can only detect stealth infantry...etc (Inspired by Contra, don't have to copy everything from it btw) Units like Sentry Drone, Listening Outpost, and Radar Van shall keep their detection capability as the original game. (Detect all types of stealth in large range)</td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td>Everything you are doing is awesome.</td></tr><tr><td>59</td><td>units get really dumb when controling them in large numbers </td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>Joker sucks</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>its about split community and change game maybe would be nice but i dont think so</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>Make sentry drones great again.</td></tr><tr><td>63</td><td>I'll be honest, I rarely ever play Generals online. However, I do think a community patch might be a bad idea for this game. It will more than likely split the player base and for such a small community it could be fatal.

If a community patch is in order I'd say it should be restricted to menu changes and UI changes (perhaps the controlbar mod implemented)

My opinion should not be taken highly as I have little multiplayer presence but I have played this game since it's release religiously and would hate to see it die out over a community patch.

That is all.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>I find the casual ZH community complaints so invalid.  Please ignore them.</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>Giving attention on the whole game itself and releasing a "balanced" patch looks wonderful for me! keep on the good work guys :D </td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>The main thing that most people don't like about the online servers (besides lag) is the "army imbalance." Personally i think that the armies are good as they are, some are better then others at beating certain armies, but then are bad against others. Like how air is generally accepted as stronger than others, but if you bunker as laser, everything dies. But then if your any gla vs. a bunkering laser, just scud spam and you win. The only thing that i can think of that is most definitely unfair are the alpha auroras, but as soon as you put down a emp patriot, everyone targets you before you can even get auroras (this is talking about defcon ffa btw). Everything kinda balances out. And in tournaments, its almost always no rules because there are multiple rounds and everyone gets a chance to be air or demo or something else. anyway i think it would be cool to have more things in it (such as more armies, units, buildings, ect.), but only minimal balancing otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>67</td><td>Not really</td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td>I'd like a bit more balance between factions as GLA is often underpowered in many circumstances. And new factions would be pretty good as long as they're also balanced well. </td></tr><tr><td>69</td><td>I'd play multiplayer if you can actually fix mismatches.</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>just look at mid range stuff like rocket buggies or the flame launchers of china maybe look at balancing those units better. </td></tr><tr><td>71</td><td>I enjoy playing ZH coop local games where me and my friends games are both modded. I'd be glad if I saw someone talking about coop or asking questions such as this regarding coop compability with mods, gameplay etc.</td></tr><tr><td>72</td><td>Mismatch</td></tr><tr><td>73</td><td>hey i think it's a shame that ea won't release a new version i hope you somehow manage to get the source code and release new generals/buildings etc. 
love greetings your Joel</td></tr><tr><td>74</td><td>"Serious error" crashes fixed
60fps
true 1080p support,
proper matchmaking servers, perhaps a ranked system
better mod support(easier to switch between them)
camera zoom improvements
improved pathfinding
visual polish
an option to random a general based on faction( GLA random , USA random, China random)
configurable hotkeys from menu(including grid based hotkeys)
a "friends" tab for inviting others easily
</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>The most and only Problem I encounter while playing generals zero hour contra is that the game crashes after 30 or 40 minutes while playing with 5 or more friends together .online or lan does not matter its the same same result in the end.</td></tr><tr><td>76</td><td>Less useless units </td></tr><tr><td>77</td><td>Not being able to have 2 monitors with the game Active.
More graphic options
</td></tr><tr><td>78</td><td>I find the lack of defenses for china to be very annoying</td></tr><tr><td>79</td><td>You can work/modify on the fan made 1.06 patch. That one is not bad but need to be worked on.</td></tr><tr><td>80</td><td>Love the game, love the modes.. hate mismatches and serious errors causing crashes in multiplayer.. Please fix this, everything else is secondary.</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td>Humvee nerf pls</td></tr><tr><td>82</td><td>I more or less just watch multiplayer video of others and I do see the imbalances between armies. When I see Air vs Swg, you automatically assume the Air will win. I wish that could be changed with a new patch; every faction/army should be powerful in their own way without having a clear Best and clear Weakest army</td></tr><tr><td>83</td><td>honestly it is hard to narrow down. while i love generals and it is a childhood game that I've probably nailed 500+ hours into at least the modern day really shows just how badly it has aged technically. so any improvements aside from a remaster from ea is welcome imo.</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td>The most frustrating things are the Crashes, there are to many of them and the AI is really weak (Single player) Nuke Cannon/Nukes Explosion Quality Improvements (More realistic), the rest is perfectly fine. New Multiplayer Features like No War/Peace until this timer is 0</td></tr><tr><td>85</td><td>I love this game since i have 4 years old and i Will love him, and it's the same for mods and all we can do for improve the game </td></tr><tr><td>86</td><td>The damn game always closes for no damn reason when too many units are on the screen</td></tr><tr><td>87</td><td>I think any improves can change the community, and ZH has a small community. So, I don't want to new patch or anything. I love this game like this.</td></tr><tr><td>88</td><td>Skirmish crashing when playing against AI, both vanilla game and mods. If there is something that could forever fix this, it would be better than seeing miss universe candidates naked. </td></tr><tr><td>89</td><td>Please focus on compatibility issues and units balance  as well as the bugs </td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>I just wish it ran better on modern operating systems. The game is great but the main menu hates modern aspect ratios and alt tabbing can cause lock-ups and crashes. I've got a 32:9 monitor (5120x1440). The interface becomes unusable at aspect ratios like this. A replacement and/or patched menu/ui would be greatly appreciated, especially if mod makers could tap into it to make their own campaigns and game modes.

While you're at it, improvements / fixes to world builder would be an absolute godsend. Half of that program doesn't work as intended. That's assuming it still starts on Windows 10/11. Admittedly I haven't used that toolkit since Windows 7.</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>I just wanna say. Thank you all for putting your free time on this and working together to a better Zero Hour! :)</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>I am just sad that mod gamers care about improving the game, despite their lack of money incentives. If the EA Games did better, C&C Generals series could have been like Starcraft II.

However, I am glad to see modders alive and well. That is a small but good consolation.</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td>i like to have better WorldBuilder to make better AOD maps.</td></tr><tr><td>94</td><td>Would be happier if you guys could making  us join games easier. It's sometimes annoying when the game keeps giving error messages (like unable to connect to player) even though we've got everything done. Overall, you guys are doing a great job! </td></tr><tr><td>95</td><td>Net code and performance in general are main hindrance for me to go play multiplayer. I live in Pakistan and have frequent disconnects/timeouts, lags etc</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td>bug and game crashes</td></tr><tr><td>97</td><td>I really hope there's a way to fix random mismatches in games (happens a lot when I play Contra with my friends vs AI)</td></tr><tr><td>98</td><td>please make a new graphic PLEASE</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td>Player base split is a huge concern for me and could kill the game.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>Could we have a way to identify build or patch numbers from a screengrab? Like a printout on the corner of the screen throughout gameplay or some such.</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>I find that just being new or getting new players is harder with pain to get multiplayer properly installed and working. Different online platforms/programs to play online with players scattered. Once in there games the disconnection menue and lag also issue for me. Maybe  ping indicator at best to see who has the poo net before online games are played. Bigger prizes pools more donations awareness for prize pools in tournaments to get high quality games/tournaments. Thanks for giving us a voice </td></tr><tr><td>102</td><td>the bugs sometimes annoys me like framerate issues (i think that what it's called) the gameplay will slowdown and laggy if there are so many units in game.
so many units and upgrades are cut in final release i hope if generals ever gets remastered they EA will finished what they left behind</td></tr><tr><td>103</td><td>All what i l really cares about is graphics and graphics and graphics nothing else</td></tr><tr><td>104</td><td>I would like to see some changes in I GenTool UI because it is same since 2014, Also i would like to see Generals Zero Hour depened on DirectX 9/10
</td></tr><tr><td>105</td><td>Multiplayer crash & disconnect is the biggest pain.</td></tr><tr><td>106</td><td>I am THE BREAD</td></tr><tr><td>107</td><td>Just what i wont is playing without crashing</td></tr><tr><td>108</td><td>The thing frustrating me most as a simi player, is the china dozer movement and the rocket bugged while shooting from high ground to lower ground.</td></tr><tr><td>109</td><td>UI & shortcut key can be more customized</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>Bring back cnc generals zero hour to life, keep the original factions and idea, just add better graphics and few new realistic weapons.. Don't make it futuristic too much it's an over kill.. Keep it normal and reflecting the current technology the world has right now.. </td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>For me there's not much about the game I would change, but then I don't play multiplayer so I don't know all the imbalances, however the main issue for me is getting the game to run on newer systems, and even when I do get it working, if I stop playing for a while and come back to it, the cycle starts again, it won't run and I have to go through re-installing and patching all over again, this is one thing that has put me off playing the game for the most part, be when it does work I enjoy it and the mods. There has to be a way to make running the game more consistent.</td></tr><tr><td>112</td><td>The biggest issue with a new patch is splitting the player base. It is very important to get as many people playing on Gentool BEFORE a patch is released. This could be done by allowing network players to see who is on gentool and who isn't. 

1.04+ should not be used as the patch. A new patch should be created with a limited number of changes with the aim of fixing the biggest imbalances. Just changing the build time and cost of units is not the best way of balancing a game. </td></tr><tr><td>113</td><td>Focus on fixing netcode of the game wich is terrible, and try to uncouple framerate and animations speed from game engine speed.</td></tr><tr><td>114</td><td>I like to see bug fix if more 3k object on map game is crash and new online service with i can play with many player and no cradh or mismatch and new mission campaning that all=)</td></tr><tr><td>115</td><td>WE WANT A GENTOOL UPGRADED INTERFACE
ALSO GAME LAG EVEN WITH STRONG VIDEO CARD LIKE GTX 1080 WHICH CAN RUN STRONG GAMES ON 60 FPS AND CANNOT RUN GENERALS UP 55FPS (IN DEFCON GAMES)
ALSO WE WANT FIXING THE PLAYERS RANK IN REVORA SERVER,IF A  PLAYER PLAYED 10 GAMES OF 1V1 [RANK]MAPS AND WON AT ALL THE SERVER WONT RECORD TO PLAYER MORE THAN 4 WINS 
ALSO IT IS BETTER IF GENTOOL WAS D3D8TO9.DLL AT DEFAULT USE DIRECTX 9 RATHER THAN 8 FOR IMPROVING GRAPHIC  .</td></tr><tr><td>116</td><td>AI behavior based on difficulty chosen. For some mods, Easy Difficulty is either too easy, with the AI barely doing anything, or too hard, with the AI being a difficult opponent even on easy. Likewise, the AI can be very difficult even on Medium difficulty.</td></tr><tr><td>117</td><td>I hope if a patch was gonna be released to not cause crash to other mods that we okay, mainly the most popular ones such as sw and rotr</td></tr><tr><td>118</td><td>Not change the game too much and apply balance to all of the factions and restore unused stuff like sounds and units.</td></tr><tr><td>119</td><td>One thing that I think will bring confusion is the "1.04+". For people unaware of the patch (that will exist alot), I think it should be named 1.07 or something else that indicates that this patch is newer than the existing 1.06, since 1.04+ will always be numerically lower than 1.06. Even if gentool or whatever program autodownloads it, there will always be a need to search about it first, and having results with 1.06 and 1.04+... I get it why you are naming it like that, its like dragon ball GT and Super (since GT was not cannon), but non the less, its not intuitive for those unware. Just my 2 cents :).
Also, how about an option for "No SW"? There is already a "patch/mod" with an .ini file for that, but an option in skirmish/lan would be awsome. The china upgrades could be moved to the propaganda center instead when the SW are not available.
Another thing, the need to press 99999 times the 1-5 stars upgrades (even in single player).
The ability to further zoom out even in multiplayer without custom .exes.</td></tr><tr><td>120</td><td>Pathfinding has been frustrating including units getting stuck on bridges and on edgy terrain. It should be fixed firsthand.</td></tr><tr><td>121</td><td>Multi-player mismatch - I would love to donate money for multi-player mismatch fix </td></tr><tr><td>122</td><td>I exclusively play singleplayer atm, and thus far the only relevant frustrations I've had are from some grouped units forgetting commands. I.e. infantry forget their commands to garrison selected structures when clumped.

Performance upgrades en late eco fix (balanced) </td></tr><tr><td>127</td><td>I honestly would play the game almost non-stop and bring my friends into it if the "Critical error" and "Mismatch error" bugs were fixed, theres a lot of forums and community made patches that suggest they fix these issues but they continue to plague the gameplay with every fix I try and I eventually turn to other games. A patch that actually fixed this, I'd even be willing to pay for.</td></tr><tr><td>128</td><td>I really hate that all USA gameplay boils down to spamming humvees with missile defenders inside of them. And i really hate that USA has auroras. USA never uses tanks. Pls fix.</td></tr><tr><td>129</td><td>Ok my main and only question: is it possible to create a game patch that would remove the need for IPv4 online? This is a big issue for me. As you probably know the game has a connection issue online if a user has IPv6 and is not portforwarded. I myself have IPv4 which allowed me to portforward ZH. But my friends dont have IPv4 they have IPv6.. and 6 is not told by the game to open the needed ports so we cannot play online at all. Im not that smart for this, but you lot would be my heros (and im sure a lot of other peoples too) if this was somehow fixable. I commend you all for trying to improve ZH. Thank you all.</td></tr><tr><td>130</td><td>Toxin RPG troopers should either deal bonus damage to infantry (if they don’t already) or have their attack graphics altered to not be misleading.

Units should display their health and damage stats somewhere, either via tool tips when selected (an ability that does nothing but it explains the attack damage, weapon speed, special effects, damage type, health, speed. Capture abilities and other ones that require that me to cast should have that listed. Build times should be displayed along with costs.)</td></tr><tr><td>131</td><td>E-3</td></tr><tr><td>132</td><td>I think adding new stuff would be better than changing what's already in the game...

Regarding changes, personally I´m a fan of balancing around multiplayer (More then 2 players on a map), improved unit movement and fun for the game. Not a big fan of balancing a game completly around the "pro-level",  1v1 tournaments and competetiveness though. 
That being said, every mechanic, unit, feature or anything that is unfun to play against, regardles of it being op or not should be considered for overhauling. 
That does not include the hard to catch Rocket Buggys, but forexample the ability of SCUD-launchers to enter Tunnel TSystems, or the sheer effectiveness of PDLs.
Thanks for spending time, effort and funds into a passion we are all sharing and I jope you will be rewarded accordingly one day.</td></tr><tr><td>142</td><td>I would love a patch with absolutely no balance changes (sorry vchina) but with a full overhaul of fixes.
Like making the ui upscaled to 4k (but unchanged otherwise),
Making scroll speed not tied to fps,
Making playing multiplayer much easier without mismatches or disconnect issues,
Maybe uncap fps for camera in singleplayer (I know all animations are 30fps but if multiplayer can run at higher fps I dont see why single cant.)

I am more unsure about gameplay bugs though. Like quads doing double damage when firing faster or double shotting with nukecannons. I know the game isnt perfectly balanced, but I would say its balanced enough, and there is a reason the pro scene hasnt already moved to an unofficial patch.</td></tr><tr><td>143</td><td>Technical errors are too frustrating. I would like EA or the community fix that bugs, in order to play with less "vanilla bugs" and improve the mod community. I hope that EA release a remaster or a remake of C&C ZH.</td></tr><tr><td>144</td><td>xezone - make ZH great again with nrw patch! </td></tr><tr><td>145</td><td>Mismatches are the most frustrating thing and the only thing that prevents me from playing at this point, but I don't see that being fixed in this patch.

I also wouldn't mind being able to zoom the camera out a little bit more... it's a bit claustrophobic, especially compared to any recent RTS.</td></tr><tr><td>146</td><td>The closer the modification is to the original, the more successful it is.
Original would be good if there were not this huge amount of bugs
and imbalance..

Bugs like:
AI's Missile Defender Laserlock everything
AI's general Kassad produce demo bikes
Laser Defence Turret shoots far units
Maps don't functions with AI
Missing Cameos
etc..

Imbalance like:
Aurora Alpha
Nuke MIG
Pathfinders are extremely strong
Mini-Gunner are extremely strong vs air units
Not all function have tanks or long artillery units
Some armies are harder to play than others
etc..

If EA makes a patch, it would be a good idea to add navies to the game.. but EA will not.</td></tr><tr><td>147</td><td>Solving connectivity issues and trying to solidify the community on one platform, is more important than bugs or imbalances. 

There are a great number of skill levels and gametypes, and combined they are countless. people with no skill, (like me), should try  to improve every other aspect of the game before complaining about imbalance. The scope of a balance patch can and should therefore only optimize the game for 1v1 expert level play. I'll just be floating 15k in a defcon match and people will make their own new 'pro rules' eventually.

If a balance patch can not be forced for all players, then I think this could split
 the community and therefore is not worth the effort.

However i have no idea how or if it's possible to  improve connectivity. For me it's a miracle this game is still playable through the original menu's with revora while the gamespy service is long dead. This does tell me a lot is possible!</td></tr><tr><td>148</td><td>Lags are frustrating. Maybe this can be improved. Also very with would be if maps with map.ini could be played without restart (when transfered).</td></tr><tr><td>149</td><td>Hmm, so basically we all love zh how it is but all are facing issues like dc and lag in game or even vs cpu and patch is really needed but the thing is i mean about me i dont like to see the game changed or something new added bcz if it added all players well play with this patch and i cant find lobbies then same with gentool bcz when i install gt the game keep crashing so bcz of that i cant join 40-50% of lobbies i think that’s it for me.</td></tr><tr><td>150</td><td>tank general needs long range unit and less xp for killing tank general units</td></tr><tr><td>151</td><td>if they fix how the game speed is tied to the fps, that would be the best change, i want to be able to play on 60 fps of 144 fps without the game and units being slow because of it.</td></tr><tr><td>152</td><td>It is very frustrating that the game is designed to run on only 1 cpu core and that there is a built-in limit on the frequency of this core. Because of this, the game is impossible without lags and freezes with many units, even on a modern pc. The game really needs multithreading support.</td></tr><tr><td>153</td><td>Aurora balance is welcome</td></tr><tr><td>154</td><td>imho if this patch will be released in future, it should fix all actual problems without touching any original vanilla content. or it will be not a patch any longer, but an addon.</td></tr><tr><td>155</td><td>I would like to see updated Graphics and a few new armies, units :)</td></tr><tr><td>156</td><td>In a fair amount of high level multiplayer matches online and streamed it always clear the full roster of units are never used due to imbalance. This is what I would like changed, everything should be viable to a degree, not NEVER used...otherwise what is the unit even doing in the game in the first place.</td></tr><tr><td>157</td><td>I rejected 1.06 because it has a lot of irreverent gameplay changes serving a paradigm that is irrelevant to what competitive ZH is meant to be about. 1.06 was sloppy work with a lot of extraneity to it and I consider it to be more of a full-on gameplay mod rather than the successor to 1.00 that 1.03/1.04 was and what 1.05a-e were hoping to become.

Any game that forces random vs random at the character selection layer is a complete joke competitively and this should have been rectified in some way over a decade ago in the case of ZH. "Army pick" as the format used to be called, should be the primary goal of every conservative balance effort the ZH community undertakes, with as many dynamics as possible left completely intact. Such alternative versions of the game must be made without compromising or complicating access to the original product, which is something the RA2/YR competitive community is bungling absurdly as we speak. Preserve the original game in its entirety and only then push a new standard to rival it. No one has the authority to fundamentally redesign a game to his own ideals.

I don't trust EA to conservatively improve any game, not after Tiberium Wars and certainly not after the Remastered Collection. I don't know anyone in the ZH community who has both the restraint and the wisdom to produce a proper series of minimalist updates to make the game competitive, nor did we have such people before the CBP was handed over to the folks that made 1.06.

If a new community balance patch were launched and it outright rejected the mistakes of 1.06 in favor of the restraint and deliberation such that 1.05 had, I would certainly give it my best shot and promote it if I liked it. ZH is my favorite game of all time, after all.</td></tr><tr><td>158</td><td>All gla armies have more adventages than others, it must be take more balanced changes </td></tr><tr><td>159</td><td>Generals is perfect.  I would only want stability, connectivity, and maybe performance issues for insane AOD maps.</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>FPS Frames Per Second information for new people  I have been playing since the game came out. I played with a low cost PC at the time and I hated the stutter intro videos as I did not know if was my machine, or if it was intended to stutter.
I finally got an onscreen FPS display to find out what was going on. Now 18 years later, just found out the speed setting in OPTIONS is directly linked to FPS. If you set the game speed to 30, you get about 30 FPS. Against an AI I can not play higher than a "40" speed so I get a 40 FPS.</td></tr><tr><td>161</td><td>I love everything you do for this game, and you're the only reason I watch multiplayer competitive ZH <3

I would mostly like to see a ranking system for multiplayer PVP, also bug fixes such as mismatching.

One thing that would be really cool but likely not achieveable with a mod would be between game progression, such as ranking up with the faction and unlocking new units / powers in PVE multiplayer.</td></tr><tr><td>162</td><td>issues with the gam glitching out or crashing and lagging are the most annoying for me personally</td></tr><tr><td>163</td><td>1. Multiplayer RTS needs ranking system. Being Semi-level and playing few games a month, it can be very hard to find anyone of your level. 2. Lags and connection issues are super annoying both on revora and GR. GR has some connection quality indicator, but... When you're starting a 6 player room would be nice to know in lobby that playerA has ping >1000 and packet losses every 10 sec. 3. Random balance in Gentool is very important feature, unfortunately working only on revora. Many noobs don't say armies.</td></tr><tr><td>164</td><td>My opinion: keep the game original but...

- switch ingame layout to ControlBar pro (big shoutout to you Xezon!!!)

- fix army/building limit in multiplayer (currently 1600 i believe?)

- fix other serious error occurences

- Something I noted down once, can maybe be useful with regards to performance:
Disabling 3d shadows is only needed when playing AOD as it creates an issue when too many units are on the screen at the same time and shadows overlap. This shouldn't happen in normal games (not enough units crammed in 1 screen)

- fix the replay list bug:
when importing replays: the replay list is bugged with some text overlaying and empty slots
Cause: one of the replays takes place on a map that is not present on the PC
Solution: add the map to the PC...
Improvement: detect missing map and give notification instead of bugging out

- improve WAN connectivity, although I've been ***mostly playing just fine online on Revora throughout the years***, many new users are experiencing issues getting online on Revora.
I have also experienced some periods of varying success with regards to getting online.
When I have to resort to Gameranger, it feels like I'm entering the ugly underbelly of Zero Hour, haha!
What I mean is that I'm assuming there's probably currently better network connectivity available for users that are behind restrictive firewalls compared the technology used back when ZH was created?
(Would that be that a "C++ network library"? I'm guessing here, i'm in IT but I'm not a programmer, I don't know in what language ZH was created...)

- I'm sure you will have some other basically "functionallity" problems on your list! :)

But please, keep the *game play and balance* original, there are many multiplayer formats out there, many high level games, the game is growing massively, it's doing perfectly fine!!
Even keeping the army imbalances is important IMHO, not everything is on the super competitive scale.
Even if it is competitive, I have seen many great moments where the underdog wins in an army inbalanced game in a super competitive set!
Being able to control the clumsy china units is part of a *skillset*, even if they are frustrating, haha.
I love Zero Hour and it's definitely grown in the recent years, I'd hate to have a "balance patch" split the community and am basically happy that previous attempts to popularise such a patch haven't caught on.

Feel free to add me on Discord if you want to discuss: Zim#5183</td></tr><tr><td>165</td><td>Game needs to be more easily accessible (like installing, playing online without issues and stuff, it can be annoying for new users to the point they give up before playing the first game)</td></tr><tr><td>166</td><td>china vanilla too weak and all units slow
lotus need more range and maybe give china a sniper? a very weak one so the impact is small?

and great job! thanks for improving the game!</td></tr><tr><td>167</td><td>-It would be great if any new patch be backward compatible: meaning that it should work with the minimum patch version of all people who are in the game. Gentools should show the patch version that the game is (going to be) loaded. Or even add an option to choose which patch to run the game with: auto(as default), patch 1.4, 1.#

-Any changes that fix a bug in the game or ease up the game play is good as well as perhaps the build time and price balancing(any other none-bug-fixing changes should be minimalistic unless it is very clear that it is a much better thing and helps the game play like the new amazing control bar.):
1. Dedicated button for gla -> demo already has it. Why shouldn't other gla have that.
2. Quads scrap issue.
3. Waypoint scouting is so stupid.
4. Scrap deny or crates deny with scaffolds are stupid. Blocking fire stations building with scaffolds is stupid. The idea of scaffold is just an abstract put on the map and should not affect anything on the map(including mines detonation) unless a worker/dozer starts building it. Ideally, an scaffold should not be possible to be killed by enemy or should not affect/block the moving vehicles. An scaffold should not be even visible to the enemy until it starts to build and any potential conflicting scaffolds(e.g with the enemy scaffold) should be automatically cancelled based on which side starts to build it faster.(start build event -> cancel all conflicting scaffolds)
5. Terrorist puts his arms up in the air in case of enemy unit present in the shadow when using the guard area and attack move option.
6. More than one toxic or radiation effect cancels the previous one may sound stupid but I don't see it as a bug. It just helps to balance in the game. I mean only USA ambulance can actively get rid of the radiation/toxin on the ground. GLAs and China's simply won't have the option to counter/clear that which is actually stupid.</td></tr><tr><td>168</td><td>You are doing an important thing. The game needs future.</td></tr><tr><td>169</td><td>Please enable sponsorship on the Github repo. Thank you for your effort! </td></tr><tr><td>170</td><td>Need a better multiplayer platform</td></tr><tr><td>171</td><td>I've read the price and build time changes and its really good! However there are some decisions made by the OG developers back in the day that I cannot wrap my head around such as why only USAv and Laser has tanks. The other USAs have to rely on only humvee spam - or why only Infantry generals hackers are invisible. It boils down to the same strategy every single game and you rarely get to see anything refreshing due to the limitation and possibilities that some armies offer. I'd love to see a crusader or paladin tank being thrown into SWG or AFG. Or all (or no) hackers being invisible. However I'd like to hear the opinion of someone that is considered a professional about this, as I'm sure it could have unseen consequenses.</td></tr><tr><td>172</td><td>A balance that essentially deletes a tier list would be fun, because then it encourages creativity and obscure strategies that would promote a more spontaneous playstyle instead of follow basic pre-existing build orders that usually lead to same-y games. I like the idea of reducing costs and build times to improve the viability of certain armies, e.g. SWG and AFG have the same Vee/Ambo cost.

But not a lot that's been said isn't covered on Shockwave mod. All armies get a massive buff and a balance that makes gameplay much nicer.</td></tr><tr><td>173</td><td>This is going to be long answer. 

Audio and graphics need to stay the same, there is a lot of mods that mess up because they want realism in graphics and all they achieve is mess where everything looks the same and blends with background. Think of warcraft 3 reforged, everyone plays with legacy graphics. We are not fighting a real war but playing an awesome game. The reason majority of community for not just generals but RTS, TBS, 4X and other similar games still play old titles is not just nostalgia but easy discenable units that "jump out" of background. Overlord - aptly colored so it's easy to discern from backgroun, big tank with 2 barells easy to distinguish between other units.

Balance. Generals zh needs it badly. From bug fixes to nèw units and powers and even new armies why not? People still mostly plau vanilla zh because all fractions are unique but have some differences. That should be main goal. So in my opinion, which I'm totaly fine if you disagree oand discard, laser point defence should go to laser general and remove from af gen. China nuke should lose inf canon and move carpet to 5 because otherwise china vanilla is just weaker china nuke and so on... I think people would be fine with sensible changes even if it adds more. 

This game is 18yrs old it nees serviceing and updateing.

Last note. I think we should add 1 more gen to each faction and add Russia with its generals too. It is about time and it fits perfectly with modern situation. Theese are just my few cents of thoughts.

This project doesn't need to be finnished at once, slow and steady so that people adjust to change but change needed so much.

If you've read this to the end, Tank you so much you are awesome all the best for the patch project. :)</td></tr><tr><td>174</td><td>Need improvements to the units example the quads scrap has to be changed they cannot get weaker once you scrap them during their veterency and overlords and emperor's need to get their subliminal messaging upgrade fixed and not just remain a bug, Paladins tank composite armor needs to be even more powerful just as the vet 2 marauder tank- Regards
Hopefully the survey works.</td></tr><tr><td>175</td><td>Control bar pro works only in window mode.

I think it would be a very difficult undertaking, however I do think there are plenty of easy changes to the gameplay and balance that virtually everyone would get behind. Those should be the focus to start. Also ZH is an old game, there are plenty of awesome QOL changes that could be made that would greatly improve things. I would certainly be all for changing minor bugs, the menu, the gameplay options etc. </td></tr><tr><td>177</td><td>good efforts ! </td></tr><tr><td>178</td><td>My important point here is that i´m not a pro player nor a very good player. Self called as semi-noob what means that my most concers lying in the fact about the player base split and this new community patch will join just the hard players which means i will not find a niche to play against my level. Anyone would say, just improve yourself but my day time is limited and i doesn´t want to spend time in just some game improvement. I´m just a player who wants to spend bit time in the evening to play some matches. But anyway, thank you all for your great effort for this awesome game.

But if there was a fix that balanced the factions out more I would be happy, (like aurora's and nuke migs being very OP etc). Also my main issue with the game is mismatches. I think adding units or other content to the game should be done very careful, this game is still alive after so many years so it did a lot right. But a update to the game can certainly bring back more people to the game again.</td></tr><tr><td>185</td><td>only fix serious errors and lag caused by maps and improve AI not to cheat and be smart only. don´t touch gameplay or how the game is played please because we don´t want a new game we want the game that we have been playing since so many years</td></tr><tr><td>186</td><td>Thank you alot for supporting our lovely game.</td></tr><tr><td>187</td><td>Singleplayer is also IMPORTANT!

Also buff bottom tier factions such as Vanilla China (worse in most aspect compared to Nuke). The game should have more strategy element into it, right now feels to micro-focused (and thus frustrating for noobs like me, hence I only play single player against AI). Humvee battles and may the better micro win. One second you're not looking and suddenly there's a tech with terrorists in your base and your buildings are gone or dozer-hunted. Not sure if this could be fixed with a patch tho :<
Anyway, thanks for the effort and good luck guys!</td></tr><tr><td>192</td><td>I do enjoy the v1.06 community balance patch + Advanced AI mod; it makes the game less broken and more challenging (although I do understand the limitations of AI scripting is on how far and "advanced" the AI can go).

It would be nice if most of the cut content of ZH was restored but I could imagine the balancing headaches that those cut content could cause for multiplayer matches.

Also it would be cool if infantries fried by lasers play the burning death animation instead of the standard death animations ala Reborn v4: The Rise to Power mod.</td></tr><tr><td>193</td><td>No i didnt_yesit is</td></tr><tr><td>194</td><td>certain armies just suck. vanilla usa needs quicker access to anti air and vanilla china is simply a worse nuke gen except for napalm migs.
SWG aurora are way too op and should be much more expensive or cheaper and nerfed by getting rid of the secondary explosion.
it would be nice if SWG wouldnt rely on emp patriots, aurora and SW, but have different options like at least crusader tanks.


scouting drones from usa are never used.
mobs from gla are never used and cause lag.

the most frustrating thing is AI pathfinding or reaction to orders. sometimes units take ages to turn or start moving which makes microing extremely difficult.

marauder tanks actually could have the ability to turn the turret.

china inf has real problems when usa gets snipers, making it a too hard counter. having something more tanky to put infantry inside than the squishy outposts and crawlers would help. gla battle bus is something that inf would crave for.
ability to heal helix would also be quite nice - having the propaganda upgrade like the other china factions.

nuke cannon bug with multiple shots is really annoying.
scud bug needs to go.
usa supply drops not landing on the drop zone and requiring units to collect it is extremely annoying. unit lost message from supply planes shot down is useless and annoying.

hackers except from inf general feel extremely vulnerable. it would be nice if they could work inside bunkers or outposts.

gattlings from overlords turn way too slow into the right direction, making them almost useless against fast aircraft.

patriots (especially laser & emp) and their anti air range bug is extremely annoying

bomb trucks can mimick drones from usa making it almost impossible to hit them with forced fire or seeing them coming. :P</td></tr><tr><td>195</td><td>The troubleshooting with modern Windows versions tends to be a hassle, especially when serious errors appear seemingly out of the blue (with no conscious changes done).</td></tr><tr><td>196</td><td>Imbalances and shitty unit movement is the most annoying part.

and can you add the snipers to stealth generals as they were meant to? thank you</td></tr><tr><td>203</td><td>1.06 was a damn good patch</td></tr><tr><td>204</td><td>I would like to be able to play C&C on an M1 macbook.

Money, even by flying, I mean, a plane brings you money every five minutes, and you use this upgrade, and the money is, for example, five thousand, and the army of soldiers. I want you to add new soldiers, because the existing ones are very weak. But it's a strange thing, why does a soldier not die from a tank bomb? All armies are supposed to have their soldiers a little weaker in the direction of tanks, and the infantry general's soldier is stronger, so your mind becomes an army of Hessian soldiers. 15 less than the super and they are a little bit. Secondly, leave the money building or the supply zone. It takes less energy with the Air Force Army, and takes a little more energy with the Super Army, and keeps it as it is with the laser and the average American. No, it is better not to be sold, because there will be a big economic difference. If one player plays and sells it with another, he will not sell it. I consider that selling the Command Center is something that should not happen because its name is the General’s Headquarters. So I expect allowing it to be sold is a huge mistake, and I am not with those who do not like to sell it. The game becomes better and more realistic. Thirdly, you add new planes to Air Force, for example a new airport, such as some mods, you leave it for large planes, such as the large stealth, the troop landing plane, and more types of planes, and you change the Raptor plane that has the laser, and you design others, and let it hit a laser strike or something like that And the Raptor, which has its missiles, becomes like defense missiles. The Super Army has no EMP missiles, and you reduce their number to 3, so that they don't become super-pilots or anything. It's sweet, and the helicopter, the Air Force, they supplied its missiles, they had ten or eight missiles, and the super helicopter is the same as the Raptor. And let it hit planes like the Air Force army, because it is a laser weapon. The extent of the explosion is a little big, so that it is a powerful plane like the Air Force, the Chinook plane or the supply plane. Leave its empty seats more with the Air Force Army. Fourth / Ground armies, let the Laser Army have a long range. As for the Hummer, they reduced its seats or places of soldiers to three or four in each of the American armies, even the normal ones, and let the laser tanks have a longer range, and let the Kosider tank bomb be a little stronger, not much at all, and let the Paladin tank's armor be stronger, and it must be, and as for the Hummer armor, I want it to be more developed The Hummer armor increases more, but it is not available. This development is in the Air Force Army and the Super Army. As for the soldiers, I want the Super Soldiers to fire EMP missiles, but by developing them, and their missiles do not extinguish buildings and tanks quickly, for example, ten missiles for buildings, or I mean such a thing. Frankly, I want you to specify the number of missiles for each building. And each mechanism has a certain number of concerns. As for the Air Force soldiers, I want to develop them and make their missiles stronger, and the laser army I want to make their soldiers hit lasers, not missiles. And the regular American army I want to take a development that makes its missiles stronger like the Air Force and Ranger soldiers.

Keep doing what you're doing)</td></tr><tr><td>274</td><td>It's Kupriyan - please don't hit... a lot of Bukaf Why spend man-hours on changing the game menu and everything else if it's not directly related to the game? - it's one thing to change the game bar, it's good to have more buttons, although I kind of know that they are tightly tied to the game and it directly indicates which unit in the producing building belongs to which button in the same producing building - change If it were, just like in RA2 indicate in which building the unit is produced, and the unit itself would appear in the menu of the producing building. And another thing is that you change the screensaver - you pay someone for it and spend time that can be spent on something useful. And counter made so many special effects, so many "unit auras" (round circles around units), that when I watch such streams, I often get lost because of the variety of this "fireshow", spilled toxins I also like the standard ones, and nuclear waste too , and the black flame - what kind of heresy is this!?. -- In my opinion, the most important thing is to make sure that multi-core processors are better supported - but I know that for this, most likely, sources are needed, which are not available. - The 2nd most important for me, as a hand-ass - a modmaker who becomes one once in a millennium, but otherwise just a hand-ass, is that there is a limit in the game on the number of upgrades existing in the entire game, more can not be done. -- I'm a fan of RA, so give water units, more air units. In general - more supreme commander! -- Would love to see more incompatible upgrades that generally affect unit categories and therefore gameplay, even those that affect super weapons and super weapon selection (more than 1 per faction). --I would like to see from the Tiberian sun the ability to chop off buildings during a lack of energy. -- More units designed for sabotage and their abilities that chop off buildings, poach units, put in a spy building (overview of the building in the fog of war and the building itself - what upgrades and which units (how many of them are alive) the building produced) -- Power plants on the maps (hello GLA) - hospitals on the maps (there are very few such maps) - the ability to sell their resources by units in command, to give to allies - the ability for saboteurs (from different factions) to sit in civilian vehicles - can make a new technical building - airfields (GLA), military factories, barracks where unique units are created. Perhaps some research centers that have unique upgrades that affect all units or groups of units. - Always dreamed that upgrades in foreign factions, if you captured them, would affect all your units, like repairing scrap metal at the GLA. For example, he captured Toxa, and after his upgrade, all tractors began to be sprinkled with supertoxins, all scorpion rockets and tank shells contain supertoxins, scuds too. Or another example - you stole a palace, or a slave and built a palace, studied camouflage, and your foot soldiers also became invisible. You can make it so that upgrades of another faction will only affect if a commander is built for this faction and (or) a certain "friendship of peoples" upgrade is learned D. -- put units from other factions in motorcycles -- Normal secondary for china. My ideas: to make it possible to build a lot of Internet centers, to make special buildings like bunkers especially for hackers, to make hackers mine more and / or faster around the Internet center. - the ability to build units in firebases and bunkers, but this requires barracks, and they will be built more expensive and longer, but it will not work to drive them out of the building, or make a button "produce a garrison", which will automatically build units in a pack, but will be built more expensive and longer than if you build these units separately in the barracks. -- in drop centers, make it possible to select units that will be dropped (for money or a different timeout), for each faction, make your choice - hello dune 2000 you also turn it off completely or, for example, allow you to build 2, 3, 4, etc. And it doesn’t work that you stole a unit from another faction, and you can build another one. -- the possibility of random boxes appearing on the map, in which there may be units, upgrades of those units that found this box, randomly - to add speed, shooting, protection, invisibility, etc., including a small bomb to destroy them, and also a single shot of a superweapon or a general's promotion (such as mines, ambush and other impact) with an indication of the place of impact, while playing a sound that some player (and possibly even indicating an enemy / friend) knocked out a superweapon. -- the ability to randomly create alliances - it turned out that player number 1 is playing near you, and you are number 2, then it was players number 1 and number 2 who became allies, and if player number 3 turned out to be near you, then instead of number 1, your ally became player number 3. Those. random magic groups, and random spawn on the map so that you don't have to choose a place. -- the ability to not only choose a random general, but to choose a random general only among the USA / GLA / China -- I really like China's mine tank from The Last Stand (or PR - I don't remember exactly) -- the ability to prohibit general promotions, certain buildings, or unit categories - air/infantry/vehicles - below I talk about the rules.ini and the launcher - you can do this by dynamically editing the rules.ini launcher for this before starting the game. -- the ability to choose the fog of war on the map - always open; "transparent" fog of war (as it is now) in already explored territories, black in unexplored ones; black everywhere. -- maybe it's a feature, but the abilities of buildings that are not your faction are not displayed in the sidebar of the general's abilities, and you have to poke buildings to use them, for example, the strategist center when playing as GLA, or the command center for the USA, when playing as china , and if you spam radar trucks for the USA or China, then look for them later, not a single hotkey is enough. - repairing and destroying bridges, drove up by units (you can make it so that builders need to drive up), and then on the bridge or in the control building, when choosing it, it becomes possible to buy (or for free) the repair of the building, also the ability to set mines on bridges by missilemen, barton, and when enemy equipment / infantry reaches the middle of the bridge, then undermine it - in some fashion I saw that the way to explore the map instead of the standard one was that you put an invisible man without weapons on the map through the ability, he could only run And he had a great review. In RA2, the research mechanism in the USSR was a spy plane. -- the ability to upgrade to self-firing guns at the bunker, and more powerful weapons at the hole, and at the firebase the ability to bunker infantry (so that snipers cannot kill the infantry in the firebase). -- add the ability to patrol (even in the older RA2) for units, as well as the ability to protect moving targets (those who played Cossacks will understand) -- the ability to "shoot" from buildings / bunkers with lotus and hackers. Make it so that they do it "actively" if the radius of the "attack" allows. make hackers more like a lotus, jarman kel like an infantryman, and only enemies will see it (when they just reveal themselves), and barton like someone else - if the USA has drones, then the ability to land with one drone in a building where there is infantry and also attack the enemy. -- why are there crusaders at all, do something with them, I want to see a lot of tanks -- I want more tractors and dragons -- I want to see more things like explosions of a bunch of nuclear tanks on half the map, when only one is blown up, and because of - the rest of the heap is undermined for it, because there is no upgrade for isotopes. In general, I want more meat with a chainsaw. For example, you are GLAshnnik, captured the opponent’s black market, and upgrades have been studied from him, let the upgrades learned from him in the black market be studied from you. -- the ability to add your own macros on the client side, as in World of warcraft - several actions are performed immediately on the button (for example, buying 5 units in all barracks, etc.). Make it possible to disable them when playing online (this is a real hole for using cheats) - the ability to select several producing buildings at the same time. -- help the second (several) builders in the repair / construction of buildings (possibly through a separate upgrade) -- the possibility of a second (just without them) queue in supplies so that they can sell money faster, possibly through an upgrade - as in each supply separately , and complex. You can also open queues in producing buildings in the same way. -- when destroying equipment - the possibility of survival of the driver - an infantryman with a machine gun - saw how the blyar played on such a map where the water level changed, make it a setting in the skirmish - the ability to manually set the water level, or random (both static and tidal / low tide, including automatic), edit maps, make sure that this setting can only be set on certain maps. -- perhaps this is also a feature, but you can only pick up garbage from vehicles with MAIN units, make it so that when picking up garbage, US / China units have badges, and also give money. -- steal with lotus/hackers/saboteurs one-time use of a random general promotion of the enemy from the command center, if these are badges for new units, or the ability to produce units, then give a timer (for example, technical badges are retrained into an additional badge when producing gatling) -- spies as in RA2 (not like in RA3), penetrate the producing building, get permanent badges for the category of units, if in the strategist center / palace / propaganda center, then a new unit. -- a small emm "ka at a moment, a gatling defensive structure during an upgrade. -- for balance, make it so that separately for the players, the server master, in the scrimidsha, you can set the "game difficulty", which adds a coefficient that affects the collection of resources , unit building time, gaining experience for promotions, etc. Make it possible to set it globally for all players with one button / slider -- the ability to finish building workers (well, or upgrade in the building itself when units enter it) buildings so that it is impossible drive them out with flash drives / toxins / dragon, and when the units leave the building, and it remains empty, the upgrade disappears, or with a small HP, when all the units leave, this upgrade will also disappear. --- and most importantly, the ability to disable everything additional modifications of the game directly from the game, for example, this can be implemented by the second rules.ini (for PA2 this is the name of the file), and you directly indicate in the game without leaving it - which rules.ini to use, and disabling by clicking mods can be done. --- You can make a separate launcher, as it is done in RA2:YR, - CNCnet - there are just all the functions and implement --- If you have implemented all this, then hello to you NOT generals, but "YetAnotherCrazyGame" --- I hope my addiction helps, good luck.</td></tr><tr><td>275</td><td>I would like to get more information online about other players, for example in the lobby itself, and in the game itself</td></tr><tr><td>276</td><td>I haven't played multiplayer.

- Reduce the cost of hackers (slightly)

- Make the same timer for all superweapons.
 
- Make spawn bulldozers / rabies from any side of the command center (not only from below as it is now)

- Games for more than 8 people (10-12, ideally 16 players on one map), as well as more colors (brown for example) and more teams (5-6, or even 8)

Thank you )</td></tr><tr><td>349</td><td>I've been playing generals since 2003.
The game lacks a stable network code, improve the interface, fix crashes and bugs that do not affect the gameplay. Run this patch, and only after that move on to light gameplay changes</td></tr><tr><td>350</td><td>I have on Windows Seven (64) Generals, in principle, do not want to work. If you can fix this, I will scream with happiness.
Z.Y. And it would also be very cool if you pulled up the AI ​​of opponents in missions and skirmishes!</td></tr><tr><td>351</td><td>the button on the nuclear artillery is missing. it is inconvenient to use it, I would like it to unfold not at its own discretion, but by pressing the buttons, such as a siege tank in StarCraft.</td></tr><tr><td>352</td><td>I'm wondering why you are all against Reborn 5.04 and Raptor?</td></tr><tr><td>353</td><td>Fix bugs and out of sync</td></tr><tr><td>354</td><td>visual remaster to the level of 2021, rework models, etc. add the function of displaying mini-icons for assigned groups ( ctrl + 0-9), add the ability to customize hotkeys for yourself in the menu. add the ability for units to queue orders through shift, add a reverse button for vehicles</td></tr><tr><td>355</td><td>Buggy in the menu and a lot of bugs in the game itself, better control is needed (selected units window, like in WarCraft 3)</td></tr><tr><td>356</td><td>Better graphics, but no cartoonishness. I hate red alert 3 and so on. I would like more realism in the graphics.</td></tr><tr><td>357</td><td>The multiplayer system is frustrating (frequent timeouts, etc. with a large number of players / units). I think it's very difficult to remake this, but in my opinion it is quite a priority task, the solution of which would draw attention to the patch by a large number of the community (other than changing the game balance)</td></tr><tr><td>358</td><td>Good luck with this project!</td></tr><tr><td>359</td><td>I really don't want patch 1.04+ to become mandatory in tournaments. In particular, to deprive the Air Force of the advantage in the form of cheap Chinooks, which is one of its features ... We don't need such "happiness"</td></tr><tr><td>360</td><td>Everything is short and to the point. All the most serious issues are raised and described</td></tr><tr><td>361</td><td>Endless out of sync when playing through radmin, game crash with alt-tab</td></tr><tr><td>362</td><td>update graphics, music and sounds</td></tr><tr><td>363</td><td>Of course, this is impossible to fix, but I would very much like to get rid of the crashes in the game and the out of sync that occurs simply for no reason</td></tr><tr><td>364</td><td>It frustrates a large number of out of syncs when playing on a grid. And the fact that on many original maps the game slows down very much even with a single player. In general, the original zero hour is perfectly balanced and thought out only the only thing to slightly change the genetic abilities and especially change the approach to the superweapon. It wouldn’t hurt to add a little reality. For example, make all superweapons automatically in stealth at least until the first salvo and then why these counters, yes, of course, there is some time before launch anyway, but it’s better that it be visible only to the one who launches it. Yes, and then it’s unrealistic that for a not very large amount, having once built a superweapon building, you can fire from it every 5 minutes endlessly. more expensive. In general, to make it more balanced and closer to reality, I would do something like this: China has the opportunity to buy missiles of different power inside a nuclear missile, of course, the mine costs the same and is invisible until the first shot. and a minute before launch. weakest equivalent to half the power of a standard core. medium (equivalent to standard
Rockets) 4min purchase and a minute before launch and the strongest as three cores in terms of power 10min for purchase and 2min before launch and the highest cost. Also, bringing China closer to reality, it would be possible to add only a nuclear general the ability to buy at the price of a core one shot from an instant equivalent to half the power of the nucleus.
  For Gla: scud is also in stealth. so that you can buy different types of scud, ordinary toxic or reinforced in the same way by the number of missiles from half the power to triple and add, for example, the ability to buy long-range mobile scuds in the superweapon building that could hit with one missile across the entire map
Naturally, they must be expensive to reload for a long time and each shot must cost some amount. Well, for the United States, add the ability to adjust the power of the beam gun and also the duration of the shot due to the energy that needs to be accumulated for the shot, for example, something like this. And the rest is all you can leave it exactly the same in the game and not change anything. Well, you can only increase the size of the cards.</td></tr><tr><td>365</td><td>It is necessary to introduce three more factions: Russia, EU, Japan</td></tr><tr><td>366</td><td>Not the stability of the game, crashes, difficulty with the resolution of the game and not a convenient camera. Glitch with Quads and scrap. Difficulty with online play</td></tr><tr><td>367</td><td>Good game.</td></tr><tr><td>368</td><td>Increased stability when playing online and removing old system restrictions of the game.</td></tr><tr><td>369</td><td>Bug fixes needed in multiplayer often disconnect, not loading or mismatch.</td></tr><tr><td>370</td><td>1) in the game for gla there is a bug with a volley of missiles, if it is selected from the infantry, then it will be able to shoot forever without reloading, 2) I would like more factions, new generals, new interesting maps for both pvp, pve, and for playing with bots .</td></tr><tr><td>371</td><td>Humvee is just a super unit. and it shouldn't be a bit.</td></tr><tr><td>372</td><td>Aurors, I hate them, *****</td></tr><tr><td>373</td><td>With their</td></tr><tr><td>374</td><td>I would like the End of days mod, where there is a faction of Russia, to be voiced completely in Russian.</td></tr><tr><td>375</td><td>It seems to me that old bugs, for example, the same hackers under the commander, are the necessary exploit. Similarly, the tomahawk in the battlechin. I don’t think that the game needs a patch, because of this, the atmosphere is lost and, it seems to me, all interest is lost</td></tr><tr><td>376</td><td>Yes, in general, I play (played) ROTR. But due to the fact that in any RTS you need to think - this is not for me (</td></tr><tr><td>377</td><td>Balance and for some factions you need to add units.</td></tr><tr><td>378</td><td>I never understood why there is no Russia faction in the game.</td></tr><tr><td>379</td><td>fix the out of sync!</td></tr><tr><td>380</td><td>Add official Russian-language voice acting to the game!
Well, or just at least show what kind there are at all and talk about their shortcomings and quality.

In general, the idea of ​​a fan patch is not bad... BUT! Still, I would be more happy if this was a patch from official developers, because players can come up with all sorts of nonsense that not everyone will like.

And yes, the most important thing: this "PATCH" should by no means coincide with the name of the original. You can call it for example: v.1.0.4.1 or v.1.0.4.5 or just "v.1.0.4 !MORE FIXES!"</td></tr><tr><td>381</td><td>I have no complaints about the survey)</td></tr><tr><td>382</td><td>Improve graphics, etc. but so that weak PCs or laptops are raised) So that new changes are not made from the balanced Generals Zero Hour to Blizzard and that the Generals Zero Hour balance is constant and that any faction can be won for any faction, that is, approximately remains the same as it is)</td></tr><tr><td>383</td><td>I really want a new version from an official source.</td></tr><tr><td>384</td><td>Remove bugs like Ural after folding the game, also a bug when you play online and someone from the party closes the game, and then it's empty))</td></tr><tr><td>385</td><td>It would be cool to introduce new tournaments, where from the start 50k money and, for example, the first 5 minutes. you can't fight. I think such fights will be juicy for mass fights, when huge packs are already ready on both sides. And it would also be cool to have a community in Telegram, I don’t quite understand the discord interface))</td></tr><tr><td>386</td><td>Greetings! I'm sorry that I'm climbing with my opinion, it just hurts me to see how you don't use even 10% of all the tools available for project development.

It's very cool that you want to develop the game through a new patch, it's a real thrill! But don't you think that EA games have already created a masterpiece? In general, the current game suits the community in this form. The game is so awesome. It just needs to be told to more people.

It is imperative to create a common Russian-speaking chat with all the players in the telegram so that the players can unite and train with each other. Give advice to each other, connect to tournaments.

If you want to develop Generals, then you just need to popularize the game through other social networks (TikTok and Reels on Instagram). There is already a lot of content for this content, just use the video from the YouTube channel and re-upload it to other social networks.

With danats, you need to hold draws for subscribers (branded T-shirts, mice, gaming headphones, keyboards, etc.). Participation in the draws will stimulate the development of the channel. But it also requires other social networks.

People will be more active in leaving danats when they see that their funds go to the development of the game and its popularization. They will feel like part of the community, not just spectators.

Review games not in one streamer, but arrange joint barter with other streamers through other channels. For example, there is a streamer who plays a different strategy, he can be offered to play Generals together, but in such a way that he must stream it on his channel. Audience exchange (mutual PR) is a classic tool for promotion.

Finally create a website! People are looking for information about you in Yandex (22 thousand people per month according to Yandex stat https://wordstat.yandex.ru/#!/?words=generals%20zero ).

You need to form a team and the first person to go there is a marketer, SMM specialist, developer and designer. All of them will download the project 10 times faster. What is an important factor - they must all be fans of the game and, ideally, subscribers.</td></tr><tr><td>387</td><td>Haubibban, when are you going to make a post to the Siries group with this poll? A?</td></tr><tr><td>388</td><td>1) Improve AI of bots in single battles (for example, add very high difficulty for bots, like in vanilla generals, in ZH there is only high);
2) Eliminate lags on original maps in battles. For example, on the Mountain Fox map, after a while, the FPS sits down to 1-5;
3) (As a bonus) Return the cut content from the developers. For example, in the call for generals, add cards with demo and infantry generals</td></tr><tr><td>389</td><td>More new levels to pass.</td></tr><tr><td>390</td><td>Thank you for your work and dedication to develop and improve zx. I hope this will not be in vain and the generals will sparkle with new colors)))</td></tr><tr><td>391</td><td>The camera in the original generals is too close, but the possibility of moving the camera away in the gentula is debatable, because in this case the radar is not needed at all</td></tr><tr><td>392</td><td>So that you can deal a little damage to the Aurora while she is flying.</td></tr><tr><td>393</td><td>In fact, in addition to the well-known desync bug, some factions really need to be rebalanced. For example, vanilla china should be raised, while aurora in SVG should be slightly fixed</td></tr><tr><td>394</td><td>fix the bug so that with a large number of units the game does not lag and does not throw out of the game this is a common mistake</td></tr><tr><td>395</td><td>I would like to nerf the CLA general, namely the Toxin General, as he is in no way inferior to the regular faction, except for just a couple of unit prices, but from the start he already has toxins that buff rockets and scorpions a lot. And also, toxin rebels do not lose battles in the infantry, since, in fact, they are instakillers at short range. Also I would like to buff Stealth General as this general doesn't have anything that allows him to fight. All his tactics are based on the fact that he steals equipment, but as soon as any anti-personnel equipment appears with the ability to turn off the enemy’s invisibility, the whole point of the general is canceled. He needs more activity and more opportunity to attack, as he is extremely weak after gaining opponents at least access to armored vehicles. I am also very concerned about the situation with the USA and the Aurora aircraft in particular. A lot of problems from one aircraft, which can always pay for itself by causing damage. If full invincibility before the bomb is dropped is replaced by, say, 50% damage reduction, then it would make sense. If you're dont understand what did I wrote here - use DeepL translator. It'll help.</td></tr><tr><td>396</td><td>Add support for current screen resolutions, slightly improve graphics, balance, and you can diversify with new generals (nations).</td></tr><tr><td>397</td><td>Nothing, the poll is perfect, like the Generals themselves</td></tr><tr><td>398</td><td>Honestly, I really like the game, but it's a little outdated, it would be great if it was updated without changing the essence and the game much. For example, the Contra mods and the rest are more or less interesting, but they are very different from the classic zero hour. I would be very happy with a good update and an increase in the number of players</td></tr><tr><td>399</td><td>I consider the main inconvenience in multiplayer to be the menu for selecting the game, since you constantly need to catch the top games, because it falls down and you can’t easily get to the top games. novice players do not download or install it and the game crashes at the initial stages</td></tr><tr><td>400</td><td>wanted to download the game</td></tr><tr><td>401</td><td>I really want to continue to play in single player mode, I'm one of those players who just enjoys the game that I met about 15 years ago. and considering how much the graphics in games have improved in recent years, I would like to change the graphics, but not turn everything into a cartoon ...

elements of futurism are welcome, but the emphasis is on realism.

and if you add anything, then a couple more generals for each faction, add those units that you created, but were not introduced into the game (you can find a few other units in the casino)

I think it would be very interesting</td></tr><tr><td>402</td><td>I would like to see the new part of the generals</td></tr><tr><td>403</td><td>I don't like it when new factions are added that are not from the main setting, for example, the USSR in generals is sheer nonsense.</td></tr><tr><td>404</td><td>The game crashes when trying to close the game. Sometimes when playing in singleplayer when there is a hidden and an infantryman, then invisible outposts appear that cause a lot of damage.</td></tr><tr><td>405</td><td>Working brothers.</td></tr><tr><td>406</td><td>melts when the game in the midst of a battle throws an error and closes.</td></tr><tr><td>407</td><td>This is my game</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>
