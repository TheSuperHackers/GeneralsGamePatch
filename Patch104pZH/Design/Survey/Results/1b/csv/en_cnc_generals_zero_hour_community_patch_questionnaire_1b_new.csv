I do not believe forcing everyone to update via gentool is the right way. If there needs to be a patch the pros are not the only ones concerned. There is a community minus the pros who play the game casually and have for years. 

Just to help pros out for a patch is bs. There needs to be a balance. No casual player ever complains about bugs that exist. They have learnt to live with them. It's the pros that complain this is wrong no this no this. 

The game has been perfectly fine for long minus a few small things but that does not give anyone any right to change it and impose a path on anyone that wants to play online.bwhat about the mods that are based on 1.04. All those would need to be redone. 

I'm sorry, I understand where you are coming from but you have no right perse to change a game to benefit a few. You can see from the manner in which questions have been asked in this survey about how you want to earn sympathy from the community because so many things are wrong supposedly. 
No they aren't. Just tell them in the face to you want to change the gameplay and buff or nerf factions. Again you have no right to this change."

Although the tanks are cheaper and very strong here, the hackers, soldiers and planes are priceless. even if only a handful of hackers are lost, that is a huge loss compared to other chinese armies. The tank general also has no long-range weapons, such as infernos, atomic cannons or Thomahawks, so is actually always at a disadvantage, because on the one hand (as mentioned above) the aircraft are priceless and made of paper, the tanks are slow and he can actually counter nothing with the long-range weapons, therefore the tank general is easy prey for the enemy if he is only spamming long-range weapons.

Another concern would be that the community would break up, that some would have the patch and some would not, some (even) fewer games would be offered again if there were a unified patch (no MOD!) It would not be a problem for everyone. If there is a uniform patch, the game design (toolbar; command bar, where houses, units, etc. can be built - like Domi, Legis-Design) should not be changed.

Another (personal concern): In Germany there is only the censored version (change of voice, some dialogues so that sentences are left out, the soldiers don't suffer when they fall) They are obviously there, but not included, maybe you could reactivate them...?

will genpatcher still work with the patch? or will it be not needed anymore? its just that genpatcher made our work from tech support a bit more  easy and i heard that there is a new one in the works but how will the patch affect it and how will it affect the general state of the game in terms of tech support? 
thas for me personally the importanst one tbh how is it with cracks or irated copys will the patch work for them and maybe also render them playable online or wil it be able to detect some of them? since if we would publish a patch that supports cracks then EA might get a bit spicy i think    anyways those were all my kinda concerns i had  one last thing the survey does not seem to get that much positive response from what i heard some peeps think that some of the question are just straight up dumb  you may or may not want to take a look into that and see what the majority of the persons say maybe just add a scale from 1 to 10 on how good this survey was "

However, as I never play online, I think the cheat system / exploits should be allowed to stay for sole single players who like to skirmish against the AI. For me in particular its nice to see what all the factions have to offer in an instant, by using exploits and cheats so you get a feel for which side you really like, then to play against the AI without cheats, but they are there if you must.

This is something that mod can't fix, some of the times games can lag a lot due to various reasons (mostly AI things). If the game could take advantage of the power of modern hardware, hope it can reduce the lag, and maybe open a ton of possibility for modding and mapping. This is one of thing require official input since it required to modify game code.

The second is that the game needs proper widescreen support. By default, the game didn't support 1920x1080. You are either required to modify ini file or install gentool, it would be great if the game has that option available by default

The third would involve some balance problem, might change gameplay, and upset some players. I felt like each general is not unique enough, for example, Laser General didn't have that many laser units, adding Laser Comanche would be the first step. Stealth is one thing that needs some changes, either reduce the stealth detection range or remove stealth detection from all defensive structures and units like USA Pathfinder can only detect stealth infantry...etc (Inspired by Contra, don't have to copy everything from it btw) Units like Sentry Drone, Listening Outpost, and Radar Van shall keep their detection capability as the original game. (Detect all types of stealth in large range)"

However, I do think a community patch might be a bad idea for this game. It will more than likely split the player base and for such a small community it could be fatal.

If a community patch is in order I'd say it should be restricted to menu changes and UI changes (perhaps the controlbar mod implemented)

My opinion should not be taken highly as I have little multiplayer presence but I have played this game since it's release religiously and would hate to see it die out over a community patch.

That is all."

Personally i think that the armies are good as they are, some are better then others at beating certain armies, but then are bad against others. Like how air is generally accepted as stronger than others, but if you bunker as laser, everything dies. But then if your any gla vs. a bunkering laser, just scud spam and you win. The only thing that i can think of that is most definitely unfair are the alpha auroras, but as soon as you put down a emp patriot, everyone targets you before you can even get auroras (this is talking about defcon ffa btw). Everything kinda balances out. And in tournaments, its almost always no rules because there are multiple rounds and everyone gets a chance to be air or demo or something else. anyway i think it would be cool to have more things in it (such as more armies, units, buildings, ect.), but only minimal balancing otherwise."

A replacement and/or patched menu/ui would be greatly appreciated, especially if mod makers could tap into it to make their own campaigns and game modes.

While you're at it, improvements / fixes to world builder would be an absolute godsend. Half of that program doesn't work as intended. That's assuming it still starts on Windows 10/11. Admittedly I haven't used that toolkit since Windows 7."

For people unaware of the patch (that will exist alot), I think it should be named 1.07 or something else that indicates that this patch is newer than the existing 1.06, since 1.04+ will always be numerically lower than 1.06. Even if gentool or whatever program autodownloads it, there will always be a need to search about it first, and having results with 1.06 and 1.04+... I get it why you are naming it like that, its like dragon ball GT and Super (since GT was not cannon), but non the less, its not intuitive for those unware. Just my 2 cents :).
Also, how about an option for ""No SW""? There is already a ""patch/mod"" with an .ini file for that, but an option in skirmish/lan would be awsome. The china upgrades could be moved to the propaganda center instead when the SW are not available.
Another thing, the need to press 99999 times the 1-5 stars upgrades (even in single player).
The ability to further zoom out even in multiplayer without custom .exes."

But my friends dont have IPv4 they have IPv6.. and 6 is not told by the game to open the needed ports so we cannot play online at all.

Regarding changes, personally I´m a fan of balancing around multiplayer (More then 2 players on a map), improved unit movement and fun for the game. Not a big fan of balancing a game completly around the ""pro-level"",  1v1 tournaments and competetiveness though. 
That being said, every mechanic, unit, feature or anything that is unfun to play against, regardles of it being op or not should be considered for overhauling. 
That does not include the hard to catch Rocket Buggys, but forexample the ability of SCUD-launchers to enter Tunnel TSystems, or the sheer effectiveness of PDLs.
Thanks for spending time, effort and funds into a passion we are all sharing and I jope you will be rewarded accordingly one day."

Like making the ui upscaled to 4k (but unchanged otherwise),
Making scroll speed not tied to fps,
Making playing multiplayer much easier without mismatches or disconnect issues,
Maybe uncap fps for camera in singleplayer (I know all animations are 30fps but if multiplayer can run at higher fps I dont see why single cant.)

I am more unsure about gameplay bugs though. Like quads doing double damage when firing faster or double shotting with nukecannons. I know the game isnt perfectly balanced, but I would say its balanced enough, and there is a reason the pro scene hasnt already moved to an unofficial patch."

Bugs like:
AI's Missile Defender Laserlock everything
AI's general Kassad produce demo bikes
Laser Defence Turret shoots far units
Maps don't functions with AI
Missing Cameos
etc..

Imbalance like:
Aurora Alpha
Nuke MIG
Pathfinders are extremely strong
Mini-Gunner are extremely strong vs air units
Not all function have tanks or long artillery units
Some armies are harder to play than others

There are a great number of skill levels and gametypes, and combined they are countless. people with no skill, (like me), should try  to improve every other aspect of the game before complaining about imbalance. The scope of a balance patch can and should therefore only optimize the game for 1v1 expert level play. I'll just be floating 15k in a defcon match and people will make their own new 'pro rules' eventually.

If a balance patch can not be forced for all players, then I think this could split
 the community and therefore is not worth the effort.

However i have no idea how or if it's possible to  improve connectivity. For me it's a miracle this game is still playable through the original menu's with revora while the gamespy service is long dead. This does tell me a lot is possible!"

Any game that forces random vs random at the character selection layer is a complete joke competitively and this should have been rectified in some way over a decade ago in the case of ZH. ""Army pick"" as the format used to be called, should be the primary goal of every conservative balance effort the ZH community undertakes, with as many dynamics as possible left completely intact. Such alternative versions of the game must be made without compromising or complicating access to the original product, which is something the RA2/YR competitive community is bungling absurdly as we speak. Preserve the original game in its entirety and only then push a new standard to rival it. No one has the authority to fundamentally redesign a game to his own ideals.

I don't trust EA to conservatively improve any game, not after Tiberium Wars and certainly not after the Remastered Collection. I don't know anyone in the ZH community who has both the restraint and the wisdom to produce a proper series of minimalist updates to make the game competitive, nor did we have such people before the CBP was handed over to the folks that made 1.06.

If a new community balance patch were launched and it outright rejected the mistakes of 1.06 in favor of the restraint and deliberation such that 1.05 had, I would certainly give it my best shot and promote it if I liked it. ZH is my favorite game of all time, after all."

- switch ingame layout to ControlBar pro (big shoutout to you Xezon!!!)

- fix army/building limit in multiplayer (currently 1600 i believe?)

- fix other serious error occurences

- Something I noted down once, can maybe be useful with regards to performance:
Disabling 3d shadows is only needed when playing AOD as it creates an issue when too many units are on the screen at the same time and shadows overlap. This shouldn't happen in normal games (not enough units crammed in 1 screen)

- fix the replay list bug:
when importing replays: the replay list is bugged with some text overlaying and empty slots
Cause: one of the replays takes place on a map that is not present on the PC
Solution: add the map to the PC...
Improvement: detect missing map and give notification instead of bugging out

- improve WAN connectivity, although I've been ***mostly playing just fine online on Revora throughout the years***, many new users are experiencing issues getting online on Revora.
I have also experienced some periods of varying success with regards to getting online.
When I have to resort to Gameranger, it feels like I'm entering the ugly underbelly of Zero Hour, haha!
What I mean is that I'm assuming there's probably currently better network connectivity available for users that are behind restrictive firewalls compared the technology used back when ZH was created?
(Would that be that a ""C++ network library""? I'm guessing here, i'm in IT but I'm not a programmer, I don't know in what language ZH was created...)

- I'm sure you will have some other basically ""functionallity"" problems on your list! :)

But please, keep the *game play and balance* original, there are many multiplayer formats out there, many high level games, the game is growing massively, it's doing perfectly fine!!
Even keeping the army imbalances is important IMHO, not everything is on the super competitive scale.
Even if it is competitive, I have seen many great moments where the underdog wins in an army inbalanced game in a super competitive set!
Being able to control the clumsy china units is part of a *skillset*, even if they are frustrating, haha.
I love Zero Hour and it's definitely grown in the recent years, I'd hate to have a ""balance patch"" split the community and am basically happy that previous attempts to popularise such a patch haven't caught on.

Gentools should show the patch version that the game is (going to be) loaded. Or even add an option to choose which patch to run the game with: auto(as default), patch 1.4, 1.#

-Any changes that fix a bug in the game or ease up the game play is good as well as perhaps the build time and price balancing(any other none-bug-fixing changes should be minimalistic unless it is very clear that it is a much better thing and helps the game play like the new amazing control bar.):
1. Dedicated button for gla -> demo already has it. Why shouldn't other gla have that.
2. Quads scrap issue.
3. Waypoint scouting is so stupid.
4. Scrap deny or crates deny with scaffolds are stupid. Blocking fire stations building with scaffolds is stupid. The idea of scaffold is just an abstract put on the map and should not affect anything on the map(including mines detonation) unless a worker/dozer starts building it. Ideally, an scaffold should not be possible to be killed by enemy or should not affect/block the moving vehicles. An scaffold should not be even visible to the enemy until it starts to build and any potential conflicting scaffolds(e.g with the enemy scaffold) should be automatically cancelled based on which side starts to build it faster.(start build event -> cancel all conflicting scaffolds)
5. Terrorist puts his arms up in the air in case of enemy unit present in the shadow when using the guard area and attack move option.
6. More than one toxic or radiation effect cancels the previous one may sound stupid but I don't see it as a bug. It just helps to balance in the game. I mean only USA ambulance can actively get rid of the radiation/toxin on the ground. GLAs and China's simply won't have the option to counter/clear that which is actually stupid."

I like the idea of reducing costs and build times to improve the viability of certain armies, e.g. SWG and AFG have the same Vee/Ambo cost.

But not a lot that's been said isn't covered on Shockwave mod. All armies get a massive buff and a balance that makes gameplay much nicer."

Audio and graphics need to stay the same, there is a lot of mods that mess up because they want realism in graphics and all they achieve is mess where everything looks the same and blends with background. Think of warcraft 3 reforged, everyone plays with legacy graphics. We are not fighting a real war but playing an awesome game. The reason majority of community for not just generals but RTS, TBS, 4X and other similar games still play old titles is not just nostalgia but easy discenable units that ""jump out"" of background. Overlord - aptly colored so it's easy to discern from backgroun, big tank with 2 barells easy to distinguish between other units.

Balance. Generals zh needs it badly. From bug fixes to nèw units and powers and even new armies why not? People still mostly plau vanilla zh because all fractions are unique but have some differences. That should be main goal. So in my opinion, which I'm totaly fine if you disagree oand discard, laser point defence should go to laser general and remove from af gen. China nuke should lose inf canon and move carpet to 5 because otherwise china vanilla is just weaker china nuke and so on... I think people would be fine with sensible changes even if it adds more. 

This game is 18yrs old it nees serviceing and updateing.

Last note. I think we should add 1 more gen to each faction and add Russia with its generals too. It is about time and it fits perfectly with modern situation. Theese are just my few cents of thoughts.

This project doesn't need to be finnished at once, slow and steady so that people adjust to change but change needed so much.

If you've read this to the end, Tank you so much you are awesome all the best for the patch project. :)"

Anyone would say, just improve yourself but my day time is limited and i doesn´t want to spend time in just some game improvement. I´m just a player who wants to spend bit time in the evening to play some matches. But anyway, thank you all for your great effort for this awesome game.

It would be nice if most of the cut content of ZH was restored but I could imagine the balancing headaches that those cut content could cause for multiplayer matches.

Also it would be cool if infantries fried by lasers play the burning death animation instead of the standard death animations ala Reborn v4: The Rise to Power mod."

SWG aurora are way too op and should be much more expensive or cheaper and nerfed by getting rid of the secondary explosion.
it would be nice if SWG wouldnt rely on emp patriots, aurora and SW, but have different options like at least crusader tanks.


scouting drones from usa are never used.
mobs from gla are never used and cause lag.

the most frustrating thing is AI pathfinding or reaction to orders. sometimes units take ages to turn or start moving which makes microing extremely difficult.

marauder tanks actually could have the ability to turn the turret.

china inf has real problems when usa gets snipers, making it a too hard counter. having something more tanky to put infantry inside than the squishy outposts and crawlers would help. gla battle bus is something that inf would crave for.
ability to heal helix would also be quite nice - having the propaganda upgrade like the other china factions.

nuke cannon bug with multiple shots is really annoying.
scud bug needs to go.
usa supply drops not landing on the drop zone and requiring units to collect it is extremely annoying. unit lost message from supply planes shot down is useless and annoying.

hackers except from inf general feel extremely vulnerable. it would be nice if they could work inside bunkers or outposts.

gattlings from overlords turn way too slow into the right direction, making them almost useless against fast aircraft.

patriots (especially laser & emp) and their anti air range bug is extremely annoying

bomb trucks can mimick drones from usa making it almost impossible to hit them with forced fire or seeing them coming. :P"
