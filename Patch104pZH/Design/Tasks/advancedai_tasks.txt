        Generals Zero Hour AdvancedAIMod - Improved by AEI v2.8
                  
        =======================================================



Hello.

This is the AdvancedAIMod0.98 /by Lion & r42/, updated and improved by AEI /version 2.8/.
The aim of the mod and my improvements is to create the greatest AI available for ZH.
There are a lot of new fixes and improvements added by me, and the AI will use more humanlike tactics as well. 

This mod was also made because the AI in ZH is too easy.
It uses stupid tactics, builds mediocre bases and normally has $50k in bank that it will never use.
Beating 7 AIs on hard shouldn't be possible but it is, this mod is to change that, giving the AI a better tactical awareness, faster expansion, more viciousness and better economy management.

So what's new in the latest version?

- [IMPROVEMENT] Comanches will finally learn to use rocket pods. They are now the deadly flying machines they deserve to be.
- [IMPROVEMENT] AI can keep its planes in the air even without an airfield, just like human players can do.

- [IMPROVEMENT] Lotus will use the cash hack ability to steal money from lightly guarded supply centers.
- [IMPROVEMENT] US generals will send Comanches to support supply centers under attack.

- [IMPROVEMENT] AI will move its helicopters away from the main base when the enemy is ready to fire a SuperWeapon.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Stealthed Garrisons - USA Snipers will garrison civilian buildings.

- [IMPROVEMENT] Capture teams will retaliate if attacked by infantry, so putting a single soldier to guard an oil derrick will no longer work.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Further improved the use of laser lock for all US generals.
- [IMPROVEMENT] No more empty Internet Centers: Hackers will move back to the Internet Center if it is destroyed and then built again.

- [IMPROVEMENT] Toxin General will use less Demo Traps, as his demo traps are expensive, yet not very effective.
- [?] Added Neutron Artillery priority for China and Nuke.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Better utilization of units for Tank and Nuke (will use more tanks/gats, and less tank hunters, who are more expensive for those generals).

- [IMPROVEMENT] Improved Stealth Detection for China factions - will use more Listening Outposts instead of Troop Crawlers. In the vanilla game, AI preffered to use Troop Crawlers for stealth detection purposes.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Faster initial expansion/base building for GLA factions.

- [IMPROVEMENT] Additional Helix attacks added for China and Infantry, and more Tech Terror attacks added for Toxin.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Improved early gameplay for most factions (better rush and defence, will  react against the human  player building turrets near AI supply centers).
- [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed vanilla issue with Demo , where he will be unable to clear garrisoned buildings due to never using the Toxin tractor.

- [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed vanilla game bug, that could cause nuclear vehicle launchers to stop attacking the enemy.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a problem, where the Toxin Rebel Ambush team will attack Internet Centers, even if there are better targets nearby.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed issue with afg supply guards.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Other small fixes and improvements



The mod Supports both 1.04 and 1.06 Generals Zero Hour patches.
To install, backup your INI folder and SkirmishScripts.scb file, then replace them with those from the mod.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Dozers are now unique type of units. 
 - [IMPROVEMENT] The SneakAttack TunnelNetwork is now added in the priorities, so now the AI will be more aggressive towards it.

/v2.5 by AEI/       June 5  2010

 - [NOTRELEVANT] Support for the 1.06 unofficial patch.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] China factions will now target with cluster mines enemy units/tunnels, instead of mindlessly droping them in their own base, even if it has mines.
 - [MAYBE] USA's Auroras will attack enemy powerplants with primary priority if they see that the enemy is low on excess power. They will also have high priority for GLA powerplants /built with stolen dozers/.
 
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a problem, where China's do not deploy ECM tanks near gatling turrets, also their behaviour is now changed - they will deploy near bunkers instead.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] USA's will deploy Avengers to protect firebases /it was already done for vanilla USA/.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Tank general will finally be able to build his "hidden" airfield and will attack with aircraft as well. Initial Helix rush is also added for the general.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a problem, where GLA vanilla do not use GPS scrambler.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed AFG ground teams that refuse to attack, as well as ground teams for AFG and SWG that do not load into transports.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a situation, where AFG do not capture sniped /unmanned/ vehicles.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Added missing drone gun upgrade for AFG.
 
 - [IMPROVEMENT] The AI will now consider having enemy patriots and tunnels in its base a base invasion, and it will build high priority base defence teams to deal with the threat. The AI will also have initial defence team to guard its base against early patdrops and tunnelbuilders.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed base defence teams - added missing attack priorities and build conditions, and fixed teams consisting of wrong faction vehicles.
 
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Measures taken to ensure that China's will fill their bunkers with tankhunters and do this fast - lowered the money requirement for the teams, increased their priority, and improved their scripts.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Lowered the priority for the hackers a bit, so that the AI does not produce them when  the base is attacked and needs base def teams or when it is building bunker teams.
 
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Additional firebase teams added for the Laser general.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Additional garrison teams added for all GLA factions, they were not having many of them.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a bug, where vanilla USA does not garrison predetermined civilian buildings.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Improved scripts for the carbombs and some dozerhunt teams. 
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed early teams that do not attack the enemy for all China's, and the Laser general.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a situation, where the AI considered gla holes to be superweapons, which resulted in unadequate behaviour and messed up AI internal clock /counter escalation/.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a problem, which prevented sequential scripts from executing properly for AF and SW generals, a lot of things are done via them /transports, filling firebases, Burton planting charges, etc/

1.06 patch note
 - [NOTRELEVANT] USA's Stealth fighters will have higher priority for ECM tanks in this version of the mod.
 - [NOTRELEVANT] The AI will take advantage of the new general points system, so now some generals will purchase more and different general powers than before.
 - [NOTRELEVANT] Fixed an issue with the 1.06 patch, where Demo was unable to use General Power Rebel Ambush, due to its changed name in the patch /now Demo Rebel Ambush/.
 - [NOTRELEVANT] The speed of the carbombs is the same as in the 1.04 patch, so that the AI can take advantage of them.
 - [NOTRELEVANT] Be aware that some of the maps that come with the 1.06 patch are not AI optimized, so playing against the AI on them is not recommended.



/v2.2 by AEI/      March 29  2010

[IMPROVEMENT] GLA factions will finally use carbombs!
They will now be able to utilize the 50+ types of cars, trucks and buses available on the battlefield. 
Beware of the cars. Sometimes they may attack in packs.


/v2.0 by AEI/      March 22   2010

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Helixes! China's finally will use their choppers, loaded with Tank Hunters, to rush the enemy. These attacks will come from different directions.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Stealth General will now build a powerplant when he hijack a dozer, so that he can build and produce faster. He will bring the dozer in his base, and will rebuild the powerplant, in case it is destroyed.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Supply guards added for all China factions.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] GLA factions will use more demo traps - in vanilla they weren't making more than one.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Better scripts for drops, terror technicals, Helixes and Combat Chinooks, so that they can attack from different and harder to counter directions, flank if antiair defences are present, etc.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Optimized some AI expansion defences, to eliminate situations where the expansion have 12+ defences or no defences at all.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed the problem, where the Helixes that guard China factions bases do not upgrade their speaker tower.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed potential problems with vanilla GLA terror technicals, and vanilla and Stealth GLA saboteur loaded technicals.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Added combat zone teams /those that guard the center of the map/ for Lazer ,SW, and all GLA generals, some of them were missing.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a problem with unresponsive supply guards for Laser general.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a problem, that could prevent most GLA factions from upgrading to AP bullets.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Other minor improvements.


/v1.0 by AEI/   January 6  2010

 - [IMPROVEMENT] USA factions will use Chinook MD drops behind enemy lines.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] AIRF will now use the Combat Chinook. These attacks will come from different directions.
 - [MAYBE] AI Dozer hunting - the AI will hunt down the remaining dozers if it sees that the enemy has no Command Center, using Terror Bikes, Tech Terror attacks, or its planes.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] All USA factions now enabled to use MOAB /until now only AIRF was using it for me/.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] All China factions now enabled to use Carpet Bombing, including the Nuke Carpet Bombing for the Nuke General /these bombers were disabled due to EA mistakes, and originaly only Tank was using them/.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Toxin General will use Tech RPG attacks.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Stealth and vanilla GLA's will send technicals loaded with saboteurs to try to reset the enemy's SuperWeapon, when such is built.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] China and Nuke will now upgrade the Neutron Shells, and scripts are added to allow their nuke launchers to use the Neutron Warheads, so now they can clear every garrisoned building, including Palaces, Tunnels, Bunkers, and Internet Centers.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] USA's planes will attack targets behind enemy lines, if they see that the enemy has no power.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed the Tech Terror rushes which were again not working correctly due to wrong scripting /for example to launch attack on a Tech Center, the AI will look for itself if it has such building, instead of the enemy/. They now also use a bit different scripts, and Supply Buildings are added for the Suicide priority, so that the terrorists are able to attack them after they unload the technical, in case it attacks a Supply center.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] The Tech terror rushes will come from different directions.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Added Tech terror attack for Demo.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed the Battle buses, which were again not working /except for Vanilla GLA/ , because no sequential scripts were used.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a Battle bus issue, where the buses will not load their teams, and proceed to attack empty, if their base is attacked when the team is trying to load into the bus.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Stealth and Demo will continue to use Battle buses throughout the whole game, instead of only once /like the other GLA's/.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed the issue, where the Bomb trucks will try to disguise for ages /Stealth and Toxin/. This was because the AI will try to disguise only those that are built at the base, but not those that are built at expansions.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed the USA bug, where the faction does not try to capture Tech Buildings.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Countermeasures upgrade added for vanilla USA, and the drone armor and chem suits upgrades added for AIRF, they were not using them.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Reenabled the Flashbang upgrade for SW USA, because it was not working, at least for me.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Laser and vanilla USA will use their Auroras more efficiently /it is already done for the other USA's/ - they will start to attack immediately, instead of waiting for the rest of their team to be built. This is done by making every team to consist of a single plane.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] USA's Stealth Fighters will now attack Palaces /because they can clear them with their Bunker Busters/.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] USA's Stealth Fighters will have higher priority for artillery, instead of tanks, since it is one shot - one kill.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] USA's will have separate priorities for GLA workers, and the rest of the Supply Lines, such as Chinooks and Supply trucks. This is because their planes are ineffective against the workers, so now they will continue to attack the Chinooks and the Trucks, but will rarely waste time and ammo for the workers and instead will prefer more juicy targets.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed an issue, where all GLA factions tanks again will refuse to attack AntiAir defences, in case the enemy has no power and then the power is back, it was due to wrongly selected China Prio Back scripts, instead of the GLA ones.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed Supply Lines priorities for Nuke and Infantry generals, some of them were missing.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Added supply guards for Laser and SW USA factions. /The other USA's already have/.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed the supply guards for Stealth and vanilla GLA, they were not working due to missing stuff. They will now consist of stealthed combat bikes, instead of rebels, since the bikes deploy and react alot faster.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Measures taken to ensure that GLA's will expand. This is because they are the most resourceful factions, so they will have higher money requirement to refuse to expand /10 000 $/ instead of 6000$ like the other non GLA factions.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a situation, where AIRF will not expand, because the requirement to refuse to expand was to have more than 5 supply buildings /this means Supply drop zones as well as Supply centers/ . So now the requirement to refuse to expand will be to have more than 5 supply centers, instead of supply buildings.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] General Power Frenzy replaced with Artilery strikes for Tank and Nuke generals.

 - [IMPROVEMENT] USA's Medic teams will hide at the back of the base, since the SuperWeapon attacks generaly attack the center of the base, so that they can survive and clean up the mess. The medics will have a battle drone, since they cannot heal themselves.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Added Sniper team for Laser's Firebases, the faction was not using them for their firebases.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Added Terror bikes teams for Stealth, the faction was not using them.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] Fixed a situation, where Demo will build 20 + defences at a single supply source.
 - [IMPROVEMENT] A lot of other small fixes.
