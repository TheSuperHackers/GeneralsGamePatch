1.1 Introduction
----------------
This is NProject Mod (NPM). A Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Modification.

This mod basically improves the Zero Hour game by fixing bugs in the game, with tons of balances, and improvement in
almost all of the game aspects. There are additional units, buildings, upgrades, etc. for all factions and sub-factions
(including Civilians). With proportion of 70% balances and fixes and 30% new stuff, as well as AI improvements. See the
"Mod's Changes" section for more detailed information.

Maybe there are many similar mods like this mod, but this mod is more focused on retoned the game balances and feature
improvement. This mod more like a patch++ for Zero Hour rather than a partial conversion mod.

This version of the mod is intended for multiplayer and skirmish only until the campaign and missions adapted for this mod.

The NProject Mod main features:
 - "Almost perfect" Zero Hour. It is what Zero Hour should have been in the first time, keeping the game's original look
   while greatly improving its content. Tons of bugs and exploits were fixed, the balance has been improved and retoned
   and the AI has been improved sightly. NProject Mod is the best patch mod you can get for Zero Hour.
 - Enabled Boss General to be played in skirmish and multiplayer. With balance and playability added, the army are based
   on what you see in the final stage of Generals Challenge.
 - More than 35 new units, structures, upgrades, and special abilities. These new things were added to give each specific
   General more choices in tactics and preserve the balance among all factions.
 - More than 15 new maps for skirmish and multiplayer with improved AI. All existing maps also have been improved with
   better pathfinding, enhanced AI, and less lag.
 - The Generals Challenge missions also have been enhanced, including the new Demolition General and Infantry General missions.
 - Small changes that makes big things. Several minor fixes and improvement have been applied as well. From the things like
   destructible props and trees, several improved explosion particles, to necessary model improvements.
 - Expanded option menu, enabled the anti-aliasing, language filter, and draw cursor settings.
 - Integrated WorldBuilder Mesh Mold Tool, with several template shapes help the mappers.

 More stuffs will be included as well in the future version.

2.0 Global Faction Changes
---------------------------
 - [NOTRELEVANT] The production speed when low power are now constant at 80% of normal speed
 - [MAYBE]       All factions Cargo Planes now have equal stats
 - [IMPROVEMENT][MINOR] Fixed the Cargo Plane propeller texture error that have small thin gray lines
 - [MAYBE]       Standardized unit transport size. Like an Overlord that needs more transport slot than a Technical
 - [PENDING][MAJOR] Fixed the issues with firing elevation limit. Now both tanks and artillery can attack very high/low targets alike
 Reason: Certain maps have topology which can force units to path around to reach their targets, even if it is within reach of their weapon.
 See: https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGamePatch/pull/111

   subfaction's Particle Cannon, or capture enemy superweapons. Use this advantage to dominate the game!
 - [NOTRELEVANT] All heroes get improved armor and healthpoints. Heroes more resist special weapon attacks than infantry, and heroes more
   immune to sniper attacks. So there is no more "Pathfinder Own Heroes" again.

 - [MAYBE] All infantry use exploded animation when killed by suicide weapons
 - [NOTRELEVANT] All infantry spill bloods when hitted by bullet and melee weapons!

 - [IMPROVEMENT][MINOR] Fixed various issues on all infantry model animations, such as running in place or skidding when moving
   door opening time were way too long which greatly affect the overall build time of all the units produced from those
   buildings. See each building changes for more details.
 - [MAYBE] Fixed the damage disparency issue caused by rocket projectile weapons due to them hitting each other upon detonation that
   makes them ineffective on massed attacks

 New Stuff:

     their aircraft if you place them correctly.

     you the free RPG Troopers) or detonated. The turret can attack like the real Tunnel Network, but with no damage. Good
     for distraction. This building not connected to the network, so if you're worried about Bunker Busters or Nuke Cannon
     Neutron Shells attacks that kill the units inside the tunnel when they're still under construction, you can build the
     fake version first, and upgrade them to real structure.

     that will scares your opponents. Except the lower building healthpoint, your enemies can't tell are this building real
     or fake because this building also have the superweapon countdown and also revealed to all players, but when the fake
     superweapon launched, they will realize that this building do no damages and they were fooled by you. When upgraded to

     dropped Demo Traps only automatically explode when there are any enemy UNITS nearby, not buildings (like Cluster Mines)
 - [NOTRELEVANT] Demoralize Generals Power
     Demoralize is some kind of "Anti-Frenzy" special power. It allows you to suppress units morale at a target area to make
     them lost their fighting will. Demoralized units got their weapon damage, attack range, and firing speed reduced to
     half. And similar with Frenzy that also affects enemy units, Demoralize also affects your own units, so use it with

2.4 Boss General - NEW FACTION!
---------------------------------
 Overview:
 This new general, General "Tigress" Leiong Leang, positioned as the rogue Boss General. She utilizes a collective of units
 from all available factions army and combine them to defeat the enemies. Advanced upgrades, buildings, stikeforces, and
 generals powers combinations is the Boss General main power. But the Boss General also have disadvantages, Boss General
 cannot fully access the stolen faction units technologies, some ability are not available makes Boss units cannot show
 their best performance.

 Gameplay:
 Boss General is kinda hard to play due to her unique minor game mechanics. She doesn't have any Strategy Center/Propaganda
 Center/Palace as the advanced technology holder. To build advanced technologies and upgrades she must build the
 superweapons, and build superweapons can provoke another players to attack you while you haven't teched up yet, makes you
 should utilize your basic units correctly. Lack of inteligence power is also the Boss disadvantage, you must send recon
 teams to scout the enemies and not just sitting in the base (or let your allies scout them for you). However, Boss General
 can be powerful in the team play.

    > [MAYBE] Clock display
       Don't play computer games too long! This will note you 'what time is it' on the match without return to the desktop
    > [IMPROVEMENT][MAJOR] Anti-Aliasing setting
       It already describe much. To set the level of anti-aliasing
    > [IMPROVEMENT][MAJOR] Replay Camera settings
       If the replays too annoying because it always follow the camera movement, try to turn it off here ;)
    > [MAYBE] Scroll Anchor settings
       Just show/hide the mouse when scrolling the monitor
    > [IMPROVEMENT][MAJOR] Language Filter setting
       Turn on/off the language filter on the online

   mod features in the Worldbuilder (see the Worldbuilder section below). (Warning: A lot of RAM memory required)

   on the bar.

 - [NOTRELEVANT] NEW MUSIC TRACK for USA! "Main Menu Theme Metal Remix" by "Bill Brown"
 - [IMPROVEMENT][MINOR] Unique icons for each subfaction will be shown in the scoreboard instead the base faction logo icon.
 - [MAYBE] Added new fancy scrolling animation for the command bar GUI, similar to what you saw in the Generals alpha build videos!
 - [DONE] Removed the map limit on Skirmish and Network map selection. Now if you have hundreds of maps saved in your computer they
   all can be displayed in the map selection menu.
 - [IMPROVEMENT][MINOR] Fixed the Officers Club Honor medal that placed at a quite odd place (if you managed to unlock it)

4.3 FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)
--------------------------------------
Q and A section. Questions ranged from frequently asked to trivial things.

-----
Q: Does this mod have a launcher/installer?
A: It used to. But then it was deprecated that it won't run properly in newer machines (Windows 10) so I dropped its
   support. Until someone is willing to make me a new one, there won't be any mod launcher and installer for this mod.
-----
Q: I can't start the mod. / The mod didn't run. / I can't see the mod new stuffs. / There is a serious error.
A: You are installing the mod incorrectly. The reason varies, but here's the checklist to help you out:

   > What version/edition of ZH you have?
     - Original CD version? Is it patched to 1.04?
     - The First Decade edition? Patch to either TFD 1.02 or 1.03. They include the ZH 1.04 patch as well.
     - Origin digital version (Ultimate Collection)? It is recommended to use Bibber's fixed launcher so you can play ZH mods.

   > Is the base game running properly? If not then you better try to reinstall the game.

   > Did you installed the mod in a copy of clean ZH folder?
     Refer to this guide on how to "clean install" ZH: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqTHHvD6etsP1Q1tBLEFvTC5kdHQAwe7mhvxwLqcPio/edit?usp=sharing

   > Did you installed another mod(s) in the same place as this mod?
     Then you are doing it wrong!
     Check here on how to install multiple mods: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PAHX8Z3GL_BxkdoiAf0QxOzEqJsgTF_eoh0CrGFtpQU/edit?usp=sharing

   > Are you using GenTools?
     Fuck off. Remove that. Don't believe those people who said it is mandatory install. It is not required to run the game.
     It was a great support tool for the game, but now they only support a few selected mods and treat the rest as "hacks".
     It even make changes to your game directory files. Seriously, stop using that elitist shit of tool.

   > Still have problem running the mod? Visit our Discord to get further assistance --> https://discord.gg/8AJGfEr

-----
Q: I see some of the textures/cameos looks weird. Why?
A: Maybe you're using non-english language copy. But don't worry, from version 2.7 this issue have been fixed.
-----
Q: I hear some buildable units have no voices/sounds. Why?
A: Same reason as above.
-----
Q: Why Boss General AI won't build anything in custom maps?
A: Because the Boss General AI haven't available yet in some maps. Starts from version 2.6 AI can play as Boss General in
   Official Maps and NProject maps. Tutorial to add Boss General AI in unofficial maps coming soon.
-----
Q: What is the meaning of the "N" in NProject Mod?
A: It's from my name, duh.
