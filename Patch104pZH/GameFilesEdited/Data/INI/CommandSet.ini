;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;Command sets are groups of command buttons that will be displayed in the
;context sensitive user interface for a selected object showing what you
;can do with that object
;
;LHS numbers are the physical GUI buttons.  You can assign a command
;to any of the physical buttons, they do *NOT* need to appear in
;continuous order ... you may have gaps if you desire
;
;RHS strings are CommandButton.ini command names
;
;Buttons for a regular command context are ordered as:
;
;+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
;|01|03|05|07|09|11|13|
;+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
;|02|04|06|08|10|12|14|
