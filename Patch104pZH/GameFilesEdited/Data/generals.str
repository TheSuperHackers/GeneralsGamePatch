ACADEMY:BuildAllStructures
"When you're on the battlefield it's important to utilize all the tools available to you, General. Make sure you build all the structures. You must maintain a strong military force"
END

ACADEMY:BuildSupplyCenterEarlier
"General, one of the most important functions of a strong leader is making sure that the soldiers have plenty of supplies. We suggest that you make sure to build a Supply Center or Stash whenever you begin a mission. Supplies bring you cash and cash brings you victory"
END

ACADEMY:TryBuildingRadar
"The Fog of War surrounds us all. One helpful way to see through the pea soup is via radar. Each faction is unique in how it obtains the eye in the sky. The USA Command Center automatically comes with radar, the Chinese Command Center must be upgraded and the GLA must build a Radar Van from its Arms Dealer"
END

ACADEMY:BuildMorePeons
"If you ask any other Generals they'll confirm a simple rule: The grunts make the army. In order to build your base you'll need to put your Dozers or Workers to work. These guys are key to your future success so don't forget them!"
END

ACADEMY:TryCapturingStructures
"General, sometimes it's easier to take what you want rather than work for it. If you build the \"Capture\" upgrade from your Barracks you'll be able to steal enemy structures. There are also Tech Buildings littered around the battlefield that can enhance your army even further"
END

ACADEMY:SpendGeneralsPoints
"With war come the spoils. Every time you destroy an enemy you'll earn your way toward more Generals Points. These can be spent by pressing the \"star\" button on the right side of the Command Bar. Simply open the Generals Points menu and spend your hard earned points on some new war toys"
END

ACADEMY:TryUsingSuperweapons
"What's the use of collecting Generals points if you don't use them? If you've purchased Generals Powers by using your points an icon will pop up on the right side of the screen. Simply press it and watch the fireworks begin. The more points you spend, the more powerful the power"
END

ACADEMY:TryGarrisoningAStructure
"Soldiers can be effective in the open, but are deadlier when garrisoned inside civilian buildings. Select your soldiers and send them into an empty structure. They'll be protected by the walls - unless a Flash Bang, Toxin Tractor or Dragon Tank comes their way"
END

ACADEMY:IdleBuildingUnits
"General, fielding and leading a great army should be your highest goal. Make sure you're building your fighting units by clicking on a Barracks, War Factory, Airfield, etc. and then clicking a respective picture in the bottom Command Bar. It will be money well spent and will help you achieve victory"
END

ACADEMY:TryDragSelectingUnits
"Manipulating your army is one of the trickiest things a General must learn. While you can click on each individual unit, it's usually faster to \"lasso\" a group of units. Simply click and drag the box around the units. They will now be in your control. If you click on another area the units will move to this spot"
END

ACADEMY:ResearchUpgrades
"A great General can make a lot of tanks, but a greater General can make a lot of better tanks. Almost every unit has some form of upgrade. It's often best to spend your money on improving what you already have"
END

ACADEMY:RanOutOfPower
"While the GLA has no need for power, China and the USA eat it up like popcorn. To keep a base running strong a General needs to spend money on plenty of power to supply the war machine. Make sure to build a Cold Fusion Reactor or a Nuclear Reactor for maximum output. Low power can mean a low success rate"
END

ACADEMY:BuildMoreGatherers
"General, make sure you're building plenty of Workers, Supply Trucks or Chinooks to keep your income flowing. You can make extra gatherers by clicking on rescource gatherer's picture in the Supply Center or Stash. Don't be shy about maximizing your resource potential"
END

ACADEMY:BuildAHero
"Jarmen Kell, Col. Burton and Black Lotus can be invaluable to your strategy. These heroes can turn the tide of a battle and are invisible to the enemy. To locate your hero on the radar, look for the cross hair icon. Though you can only build one at a time don't underestimate their importance"
END

ACADEMY:PickStrategyCenterPlan
"The US Strategy Center is a very helpful structure. You should remember to choose the strategy that best fits your gameplan. Search & Destroy, Bombardment and Hold the Line are all excellent ways to give you the edge you need. Along with these overall strategies you can purchase many upgrades from this building"
END

ACADEMY:UseTunnelNetwork
"When it comes to the GLA sneaking around the battlefield is their calling card. Tunnel Networks offer defense capabilities but they also allow the player to move around quickly. Simply build a few Tunnel Networks and send your units inside. Click on the structure and you can expel them from any other Tunnel Network anywhere on the map. They are key to the overall GLA strategy"
END

ACADEMY:UseControlGroups
"Managing a large army can be a bit unruly sometimes. One way to manage lots of units easily is by creating a \"control group\". Simply select the group of units in question and press \"Ctrl\" & a number at the same time. Now anytime you press this number, the group of units will be selected. Tap the number twice quickly and the camera view will center over the group"
END

ACADEMY:UseSecondaryIncomeMethods
"General, acquiring supplies later in a mission can be difficult. Each faction has a unique way to gain funds during long battles. China can build Hackers and an Internet Center. You can direct the Hackers to hack the internet for funds anywhere or just send them inside Internet Center to gain money even quicker. The GLA depends on the Black Market and the USA relies on the Supply Drop. If you don't plan ahead you may have shortages"
END

ACADEMY:ClearBuildings
"Garrisoned buildings can be tough to handle - unless you know some tricks. Upgrade your USA Rangers with Flash Bangs, build GLA Toxin Tractors or Chinese Dragon Tanks to quickly clear out these strong points. The USA also can upgrade to the Bunker Buster to even clear out Tunnel Networks!"
END

ACADEMY:PickUpSalvage
"The GLA is a sneaky bunch but they're also resourceful. Whenever the GLA units destroy another vehicle a salvage bonus is left behind. Roll over the salvaged parts to upgrade your units, gain veterancy or get some extra cash. Salvage can make a big difference in a long fight so don't leave it just lying around"
END

ACADEMY:UseGuardAbility
"Sometimes it's important that units stay put and guard a particular area. Simply select the unit and press the \"shield\" button or \"G\" key and then select the area to be guarded. The unit will attack any enemies that enter its guard radius"
END

ACADEMY:MultipleSupplyCenters
"Supplies are the name on the game, General. They can be gathered at Supply Docks littered around the battlefield. While one dock may be enough early on it's usually best to branch out and find a few more during a mission. You'll need to build a Supply Center or Stash close to the Supply Dock to ensure efficient collection"
END

ACADEMY:GarrionVehicle
"Some units may enter or steal other vehicles. Stealing vehicles with Hijackers or Terrorists can allow you to sneak into enemy territory"
END

ACADEMY:UseSelectionHotkeys
"General, hotkeys are a great way to enhance your control of your forces. \"E\" will select all of the same unit types on the view screen. If you tap \"E\" twice quickly it will select all the same type across the entire battlefield. \"Q\" will select all your combat units on the map. \"W\" will select all your air units on the map. Give them a try, they'll help you out"
END

ACADEMY:AlternateMouseInterface
"One new addition is the \"Alternate Mouse Interface\" option located in the Options Menu. If you are used to commanding armies using right click as your action button then this may help you get a better handle on your army"
END

ACADEMY:DoubleClickAttackMoveGuard
"General, we have created a new way to direct your army. Simply select your units and double click the destination area. Your units will attack-move to the spot and then guard it. You may enable this through the options menu"
END

ACADEMY:BuildBarracksSooner
"In order to create a well balanced force you must build a Barracks earlier in the mission. Infantry can make or break your gameplan so it's best not to forget them"
END

ACADEMY:BuildWarFactorySooner
"While infantry and airpower can be great assets nothing quite beats a good tank. Be sure to build a War Factory or Arms Dealer earlier in the mission"
END

ACADEMY:BuildTechStructureSooner
"For the advanced weaponry there is no replacement for a Strategy Center, Propaganda Center or Palace. Don't forget to build one a bit earlier in missions to ensure success"
END

ACADEMY:NoIncome
"General, it's vital to your success that your income flow continues throughout the mission. Too many gaps lead to losing your edge. Make sure you're keeping the supplies rolling in consistently"
END

ACADEMY:ClearMines
"Demo Traps and mines can really be the start of a bad day. These sneaky tactics can be combated by using Dozers or Workers to clear these dangerous areas out"
END

ACADEMY:UnmannedVehicles
"General, some units can snipe or remove enemy drivers of a vehicles. When this occurs the vehicles become neutral and can be \"borrowed\" from the enemy. Feel free to go for a ride at your enemy's expense"
END

ACADEMY:DisguisedUnits
"Some units can disguise themselves as other units. There is nothing quite as satisfying as rolling a GLA Bomb Truck into an enemy base undetected and causing lots of havoc. Make sure to use this key tactic to further your battle plan"
END

ACADEMY:StealthUpgrade
"Some structures can be upgraded to camouflage, like the GLA Tunnel Network or Stinger Sites. These will be invisible to the enemy until its too late. Surprise!"
END

ACADEMY:Firestorm
"China has the unique ability to create a Firestorm when multiple MiGs or Inferno Cannons target a single enemy or area. Make sure to coordinate your attacks for maximum effect"
