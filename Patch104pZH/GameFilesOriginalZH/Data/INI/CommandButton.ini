;SPECIAL ABILITY
;Tank hunter rushes a tank to plant deadly TNT.
;Author: Kris -- July 2002
;
;@todo info -- The reason this is a special ability instead of a regular
;attack are:
;1) Weapon reload timer currently don't cycle like special powers delays.
;2) Attack options aren't detailed enough to allow for specific target types.
;3) Attack commands don't allow for valid/invalid cursors.
