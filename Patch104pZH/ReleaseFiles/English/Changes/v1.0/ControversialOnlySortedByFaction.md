### 2022-08-02 - Decreases kill experience reward for Battlemaster, Marauder, Crusader, Paladin, Microwave by 30% <a name='link__20220802__412_tanks_xp_reward'></a>
**Changes**

- **TWEAK**: Destroying a Battlemaster, Marauder, Crusader, Paladin, Microwave now rewards 30% less, 70 70 140 280 instead of 100 100 200 400 or 100 100 200 300 experience points (XP). This gives a more balanced kill reward for generally easy-to-kill tanks.

### 2022-11-08 - Decreases SEARCH AND DESTROY stealth detection range of USA Strategy Center from 500 to 300 <a name='link__20221108__1457_strategy_center_detection_range'></a>
**Changes**

- **TWEAK**: The SEARCH AND DESTROY stealth detection range of the USA Strategy Center is decreased by 40%, from 500 to 300. As all heroes (now) have a sight range of 400, options for reacting to a Strategy Center's presence before being detected are incredibly limited. Not only this, but the structure's extensive stealth detection range over the owner's entire base effectively renders heroes useless - on top of the substantial range bonus that SEARCH AND DESTROY provides. Reducing the stealth detection range is a reasonable way to counterbalance the incredible effectiveness of SEARCH AND DESTROY without directly affecting the bonus itself.

**Changes**

- **TWEAK**: The SEARCH AND DESTROY shroud clearing range bonus of the USA Strategy Center is decreased by 25%, from 800 to 600. Accordingly, the Strategy Center no longer has this large shroud clearing range of 800 under the effects of Search and Destroy. It was an unnecessary advantage for USA that discounts map awareness. The range has been reduced to a more palatable range of 600 - a 1.5x increase of the default sight range of 400. This was preferred over reducing the default vision of 400 to 300 due to the Bombardment cannon's weapon range of 400.

**Changes**

- **TWEAK**: The USA unit armor bonus from the HOLD THE LINE Battle Plan is increased from 11.1% to 20.0%. Armor bonus is synonymous for damage resistance. This makes the use of the HOLD THE LINE Battle Plan more attractive for all USA factions. Traditionally USA favors the SEARCH AND DESTROY Battle Plan above the others by a large margin.

### 2023-06-20 - Prioritizes larger Toxin and Radiation fields over smaller ones <a name='link__20230620__2023_hazard_field_cleanup_health_and_damage'></a>
**Changes**

- **TWEAK**: Prioritizes larger Toxin and Radiation fields over smaller ones by assigning different amounts of hazard cleanup health and damage to different hazard field sizes. The huge fields of the Anthrax Bomb and Nuke Missile are 2 times stronger than large fields. Large fields of Scud Storm missiles are 5 times stronger than medium fields. And medium fields of Scud Launcher, Toxin Truck, Bomb Truck and Nuclear Reactor are 10 times stronger than small fields. With this progression it is no longer possible to cleanup large hazard fields with just one small hazard field put on top. Overall many hazard cleanups will take more effort and time than originally, unless the created hazard field is equal or larger than the overlapped hazard field.

- **TWEAK**: Killing a China Hacker now rewards 50 60 80 100 instead of 50 100 150 400 experience points (XP). This is a significant reduction. The new values have been choosen because the USA Drop Zone, worth 4 Hackers, gives 200 XP flat. And a Vet 3 Hacker makes twice as much money as he started with, so a doubling of XP is reasonable. Killing 4 Vet 3 Hackers would give 400 XP, twice as much as a Drop Zone and Black Market.
