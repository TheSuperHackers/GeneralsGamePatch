Position Converter: Is a useful tool made by NOH (Nizar [Rage]#3003) for converting Buildings Positions from World Builder to equivalent Positions to be used inside AIData.ini.

So now, using this tool, you can design your base in World Builder, and quickly know the XY positions to be used in AIData.ini  without having to keep testing for arbitrary positions in that file which were expected to work.. and most of the time didn't.

requirements: Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (x86)
